<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  This script produces single-precision floating point versions of
  various statistics files produced by Fiasco.  This is useful when
  reading that data into other programs (like AFNI) which cannot
  handle double precision.  It is meant to be called from the top
  directory of a Fiasco run, which typically contains the subdirectory
  "stat".  It finds files to convert by itself, and so needs no
  parameters.  Output ends up in the subdirectory stat_float .

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  The script finds interesting statistics files by sourcing 
  $FIASCO/epi.defaults.csh and several local.csh files and then
  searching for environment variables of the form "F_STAT_?PATH"
  where ? is any character.  This picks up the directories used
  by the "stats.csh" script among others.  Unique directories are
  searched for .mri files to convert.

  If the root filename found ends in _t, _f, or _q, the file is
  ignored. These files are the thresholded statistics produced 
  by makeps.csh and it makes no sense to read them in elsewhere.
  If the "images" chunks of the remaining files are double precision 
  and the filenames do not begin with Pmap the files are converted to
  floats in the output directory.  Other remaining files are copied
  as they are to the output directory.  

  Pmap files are copied but not converted because the interesting
  parts of a Pmap are values very near 0.0 or 1.0, and there may
  not be enough bits in a float to represent that data with acceptable
  accuracy.
