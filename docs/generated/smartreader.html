<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  smartreader is used to convert data to standard Pittsburgh
  format.  It knows a variety of header formats and can parse them
  for file structure information; alternately that information can
  be given on the command line.

  smartreader [-input In-file] [-out Out-file] [-ignoreheader]
            [-dimorder abc...] [-dims a-dim:b-dim:c-dim:...] 
            [-offset N-bytes] 
            [-skip N-bytes] [-sliceskip N-bytes] 
            [-skips xskip:yskip:zskip:tskip]
            [-type Data-type] [-tag idtag] [-xchop] [-ychop] 
            [-autoscale] [-autoscale_range range]
            [-bigendian | -littleendian] [-phaseref Phaseref-file]
            [-bandpass Bandpass-dir] [-rampfile Rampsample-file] 
            [-auxfile Auxiliary-info-file]
            [-debug] [-verbose] [-multi] [ -def key[=value] ]

  smartreader -help [topic]

  Command Line Options (see Arguments:flag)

  -help   Engage help system, providing help on topic, if supplied,
          or starting the interactive help system otherwise.

  Note: In-file and Out-file must differ.

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>

  -input Old-data-file        (-i In-file)

     Specifies that data should be read from In-file.
     Default value is "input.dat".  

     Note: If In-file and Out-file have identical names
           an error results and the program exits.

</pre>
<h3>out</h3>
<pre>

  -output Header-file      (-out Out-file)

     Specifies that output header should be written to Out-file;
     any chunk files will be given names derived from this name.
     Default value is "output.mri".

</pre>
<h3>def</h3>
<pre>

  -def key=value

     Specifies that the given key-value pair is to be defined in
     the output dataset.  Any pair defined in this way may be
     overridden when the input file header is scanned.  The type
     of the pair is determined from the type of the value, as
     follows:  

       If "=value" is omitted, key is defined to be a boolean and set 
       to true.  

       If the value is "TRUE" or "FALSE" or any common equivalent, 
       the pair is defined to be boolean with the given value.  (Note 
       that the values 1 and 0 will not work this way; see below).  

       If the value contains only digits and the characters '+' and
       '-', the pair is treated as having an integer value.

       If the value contains only digits and the characters '+','-',
       '.', 'e', or 'E', the pair is treated as having a double
       precision floating point value.

       Otherwise the pair is treated as having a string-type value.

    Note that ill-formed integers or doubles will result in parsing
    errors; trying to set a string-type pair with a value like
    "123+45" will fail.

</pre>
<h3>dimorder</h3>
<pre>

  -dimorder abc...          (-do abc...)

     Specifies the string of dimensions in the data array, left
     varying fastest.  For complex data, this string should start
     with "v".  Any string of unique characters is legal.  This
     optional argument will override any dimorder information 
     derived from the input file header. This argument
     specifies the actual layout of data in the input file, and 
     it will be identical to the layout of the data in the output 
     dataset.

</pre>
<h3>dims</h3>
<pre>

  -dims A-Dim:B-Dim:C-Dim:...    (-di A-Dim:B-Dim:C-Dim:...)

     Specifies length (extent) of each dimension of the data, given
     in the same order as the dimensions defined by the -dimorder
     argument.  This optional argument will override any dims
     information derived from the input file header.  

</pre>
<h3>ignoreheader</h3>
<pre>

  -ignoreheader

     By default, smartreader will try to identify the input data file
     and process it accordingly, using command line values only when
     necessary (though some command line arguments can override
     information taken from the file).  This flag tells smartreader
     not to scan the input file, but rather to treat it as raw data
     and attempt to translate it based only on command line arguments.

</pre>
<h3>offset</h3>
<pre>

  -offset N-bytes             (-o N-bytes)

     Specifies the number of bytes to be ignored at the beginning
     of In-file.  This optional argument will override any offset
     derived from the input file header.

</pre>
<h3>skip</h3>
<pre>

  -skip N-bytes               (-s N-bytes)

     Specifies the number of bytes to skip (in In-file) between
     cycles through the second-to-last dimension.  For example,
     If dimorder is vxyzt, this number of bytes is skipped between 
     each image read (i.e. each read of X-Dim*Y-Dim*Z-Dim values).  If 
     dimorder is vxytz, this number of bytes is skipped after each 
     group of T-Dim images. This optional argument will override any 
     offset derived from the input file header, and can in turn
     be overridden by the -skips argument.

</pre>
<h3>sliceskip</h3>
<pre>

  -sliceskip N-bytes               (-ss N-bytes)

     Specifies the number of bytes to skip (in In-file)
     between cycles through the third-to-last dimension.  For 
     example, if dataorder is vxyzt, the bytes are skipped after 
     each slice (vxy) is read.  This optional argument will override 
     any offset derived from the input file header, and can in turn
     be overridden by the -skips argument.

</pre>
<h3>skips</h3>
<pre>

  -skips a-skip:b-skip:c-skip:... 

     Specifies the number of bytes to skip (in In-file) between
     cycles of each dimension.  Dimensions can be omitted (leaving
     the ':' separators), in which case no skip will be set for
     the corresponding dimension.  Note that these values are
     skipped after the corresponding run of data is read, not before;
     adjust the -offset value to compensate if necessary.  This
     argument has no default and can override all other mechanisms
     of setting skip lengths.

</pre>
<h3>type</h3>
<pre>

  -type Data-type             (-t Data-type)

     Specifies the binary storage type of the data in Old-data-file.
     The possible values of Data-type are:
        "uchar"  (or "u" or "MRI_UINT8")           :  unsigned char
        "short"  (or "s" or "MRI_INT16")           :  short int
 "ushort" (or "us" or "SRDR_UINT16")        :  unsigned short int
        "long"   (or "l" or "MRI_INT32" or "int")  :  long int
        "float"  (or "f" or "MRI_FLOAT32")         :  float
        "double" (or "d" or "MRI_FLOAT64")         :  double
     Default value is "short".  

     Note: The datatype of the output Pgh MRI dataset may not match
           this datatype, because of filtering computations which
           may be performed.


</pre>
<h3>tag</h3>
<pre>

  -tag idtag

     Specifies that the given string is to be associated with the
     data by including it in the Pittsburgh MRI file produced.  The
     tag will become the value of the key "images.scan.id".  
     This is typically used to attach a unique scan ID to the file. 

</pre>
<h3>xchop</h3>
<pre>

  -xchop

     Specifies that the boolean key-value pair (chunkname).xchop 
     should be set to true for the dataset read from the input file.
     This flag is used to specify that the zero frequency data in the 
     frequency encoding direction comes first in each k space row of 
     input data, rather than in the middle of the row.  This will
     cause downstream processing steps to phase shift the
     data by pi/2, putting the zero frequency component in mid-row
     in keeping with the Fiasco convention.

</pre>
<h3>ychop</h3>
<pre>

  -ychop

     Specifies that the boolean key-value pair (chunkname).ychop 
     should be set to true for the dataset read from the input file.
     This flag is used to specify that the zero frequency data in the 
     phase encoding direction comes first in each k space row of 
     input data, rather than in the middle of the row.  This will
     cause downstream processing steps to phase shift the
     data by pi/2, putting the zero frequency component in mid-row
     in keeping with the Fiasco convention.

</pre>
<h3>autoscale</h3>
<pre>

  -autoscale

     Specifies that the boolean key-value pair (chunkname).autoscale
     should be set to true for the dataset read from the input file.
     This will cause downstream processing steps to scale their output
     to a type-specific range (specified by the key-value pair
     (chunkname).autoscale_range ).

</pre>
<h3>autoscale_range</h3>
<pre>

  -autoscale_range range

     Specifies that the boolean key-value pair (chunkname).autoscale_range
     should have the given value for the dataset read from the input file.
     This will cause downstream processing steps to scale their output
     to the given range, if (chunkname).autoscale is also set (see
     -autoscale)

</pre>
<h3>phaseref</h3>
<pre>

  -phaseref Phaseref-file

     Specifies the GE LX2 phase reference file for use with this
     data.  This file typically is named "ref.dat".  There is no
     default; absense of this flag means that phase reference
     correction is not carried out.  If In-file is found to be of an
     appropriate type, smartreader reads this data file and saves the 
     values in the "phaseref_const" and "phaseref_linear" chunks in 
     the output dataset.  If In-file is not of an appropriate type,
     the -phaseref flag is ignored.

</pre>
<h3>bandpass</h3>
<pre>

  -bandpass Bandpass-dir

     Specifies the directory in which GE LX2 bandpass correction
     files are to be found.  There is no default; absense of this
     flag means that bandpass correction is not carried out.
     These files have names like "bcrcvs1.dat", "bcrcvs2.dat", etc.
     If In-file is found to be of an appropriate type, smartreader 
     reads this data file and saves the values in the "bandpass" 
     chunk in the output dataset.  If In-file is not of an appropriate 
     type, the -phaseref flag is ignored.

</pre>
<h3>rampfile</h3>
<pre>

  -rampfile Rampsample-file

     Specifies the GE LX2 ramp sampling correction data file for
     use with this data.  This file is typically named "vrgf.dat".  
     There is no default; absence of this flag means that ramp
     sampling correction is not carried out.  If In-file is found to 
     be of an appropriate type, smartreader reads this data file and 
     saves the values in the "rampsample" chunk in the output dataset.
     If In-file is not of an appropriate type, the -phaseref flag is 
     ignored.

</pre>
<h3>auxfile</h3>
<pre>

  -auxfile Auxiliary-info-file

     Specifies the name of a file containing additional
     format-specific information about the dataset.  For example,
     Siemens "meas.out" k-space data files have an associated
     "meas.asc" file containing additional information.  The format
     and processing of this file depends on the format of the input
     data file.

</pre>
<h3>bigendian</h3>
<pre>

  -bigendian

     Specifies that the input is in bigendian order.  This is only
     of concern if the input comes from a foreign machine.  The
     default is to expect bigendian input data (since all the MRI
     scanners we know of produce data in that order) unless parsing
     the input file header indicates otherwise.

</pre>
<h3>littleendian</h3>
<pre>

  -littleendian

     Specifies that the input is in littleendian order.  This is only
     of concern if the input comes from a foreign machine.  The
     default is to expect bigendian input data (since all the MRI
     scanners we know of produce data in that order) unless parsing
     the input file header indicates otherwise.

</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>

  -debug

     Causes debugging output to be written to stderr.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>

  -verbose

     Causes verbose output.

</pre>
<h3>multi</h3>
<pre>

  -multi

     Causes wildcard expansion of the input filename, where the
     characters '#' or '?' in the root filename are used to match 
     any letter, and the characters '*' or '^' are used to match any 
     sequence.  Only one '*' or '^' per filename is supported.  All 
     matching files are processed collectively; see the examples. This
     option can be used to cause multiple 1-slice images to be read to
     form a data volume, or to use multiple single volumes to form a
     time series.  NOTE that if you're not careful the shell will expand
     your wildcard characters before smartreader ever sees them!


</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>KnownFileTypes</h3>
<pre>

  smartreader can identify the following data file types:

    AFNI .HEAD files and the associated .BRIK 

    ANALYZE format files (.hdr and .img pairs)

    DICOM format files as generated by Siemens or GE scanners

    FIFF tagged image files

    GE LX data files for several EPI pulse sequences, 2dfast, and for 
      spiral sequences with pulse sequence ID strings "splx1" and later.

    GE LX images in GEMS format

    Pittsburgh MRI (.mri and .dat pairs)

    PNG image files

    TIFF image files, with many exceptions

    Zeiss LSM image files (via the TIFF reader with some extra features)

    Siemens internal k-space data files with MDH information

    Windaq binary data files

  Several custom file formats are also supported.  smartreader can 
  also read raw data files, given appropriate command line arguments.  
  If it can't identify the format of a particular file it will treat 
  the file as raw data and "do its best".

</pre>
<h3>ByteOrder</h3>
<pre>

  Data files contain the data, stored in binary format.  By default,
  the input is assumed to be in bigendian byte order; this is the
  format produced by scanners (to our knowledge).  Output data is
  written in the native byte order of the machine running "smartreader".
  Since Pittsburgh MRI format includes information about the byte
  order of its data, the user should not need to be concerned with the
  byte order of "smartreader"'s output.

  For input data with a structure recognized by smartreader, the
  program can generally infer the byte order of the input.  For raw
  data, the user may need to specify the input data order (the default
  being bigendian).

</pre>
<h3>DataType</h3>
<pre>

  For input data with a structure recognized by smartreader, the
  program can generally infer the data type of the input.  For raw
  data, the user may need to specify the input data order (the default
  being short ints).

  Recognized data types are:

    "uchar"  -  8-bit ints
    "short"  - 16-bit ints
    "int"    - 32-bit ints
    "float"  - 32-bit floats
    "double" - 64-bit floats
  
  The output datatype will match the input datatype, unless the
  details of an input operation force "smartreader" to convert 
  to floating point.  Since the Pittsburgh MRI format includes 
  information about the stored datatype, it is not usually necessary
  for the user to be concerned with the output data type.  If
  necessary, the utility program "mri_type_convert" can be used to
  convert the output dataset to another format.

</pre>
<h3>DifferencesFromReader</h3>
<pre>

  The older "reader" program supported some options which smartreader
  does not support.  In particular, smartreader never reorders data,
  and so there is no -reorder flag.  If you want to reorder the output
  of reader, use mri_permute or mri_scan_fold as appropriate.

</pre>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<pre>

  Smartreader is a very modular program, consisting of a series of
  plug-in format recognizers and associated header-parsing and data-
  reading routines.  The routines that parse the header and read
  the data for a given file format make up a FileHandler for that
  routine.  The various FileHandler types make up a shallow object-
  oriented hierarchy.

  Smartreader maintains a list of datasets to be read.  Each dataset
  will produce one Pittsburgh MRI "chunk" in the output file.  The
  list starts empty; after a bit of pre-processing the input file will
  become the first element on the list.

  Smartreader accumulates information about each dataset as a set of
  key-value pairs, like "datatype=short" or "dz=27".  When reading
  the algorithm below, remember that there is one set of key-value
  pairs for every dataset, and that each dataset produces one chunk.
  The pairs associated with a given dataset are called the associated
  Info.

  Starting with an empty list of datasets, smartreader runs the
  following algorithm:

  1) Set up some key-value pairs for the dataset which will contain
     the actual data from the input file.  This is done by:

    a) Certain default key-value pairs are defined.
    b) Definitions are added from the command line.  Almost all
       command line arguments are implemented this way.

  2) The input file is scanned, and it is associated with a
     FileHandler.  If its type can be identified, a clever FileHandler
     which can read its header information is used.  If not,
     a FileHandler which simply reads raw data files is used.

  3) The Info and FileHandler for the input file are appended to the
     list of input datasets.

  4) A loop then begins, and continues until the list of inputs is
     empty.  The steps of the loop are:

    a) The active dataset is the first one in the list.
    b) The active FileHandler processes the dataset header,
       adding more key-value pairs to the active Info.  It
       may also append more datasets to the list.  This mechanism
       allows one dataset to force another to be loaded.  For
       example, ramp-sampled EPI data forces the ramp sampling
       information to be loaded this way.
    c) If present, certain command-line pairs override other pairs.
       The overriding pair names begin with the prefix "cl_" and
       override the similary-named pairs derived from the header.
    d) The resulting Info is checked for consistency.  If it is 
       inconsistent or insufficient to load the dataset, a fatal
       error results.  (These errors can be overcome by adding
       the needed definitions from the command line).
    e) The reader mechanism of the active FileHandler is used to
       actually transfer the data for this dataset to the output
       file.
    f) The active dataset is popped off the list.       

  Try setting the -verbose flag to see the key-value pairs associated
  with each dataset.  Additional key-value pairs are used to associate
  definitions and external names with each of the main pairs.

<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>

  To convert a GE LX Pfile (EPI or spiral) to an appropriate
  Pittsburgh MRI dataset, use:

   smartreader -input Pfilename -output outfile

  Of course, this is limited by our knowledge of the peculiarities of
  particular Pfile formats.

  To convert a whole set of GE LX Image files (with names like I.001,
  I.002, etc.) to an appropriate Pittsburgh MRI dataset, use:

   smartreader -input I.### -output outfile -multi

  To convert a raw file containing 128x64 k-space images in the form
  of short ints, with 27 slices, 162 times, and no extra bytes to be
  skipped, use:

   smartreader -input fname.raw -dimorder vxyzt -dims 2:128:64:27:162
      -output outfile -type short

  (all on one line, of course).  This assumes that all slices for one
  time appear before the first slice for the next time, which is the
  most common case.  The -type flag could be omitted, as short is the
  default.

  To convert an AFNI dataset to Pittsburgh MRI format, use:

   smartreader -input fullafniname.HEAD -output outfile

  To read a Siemens k-space "meas.out" dataset and its associated
  auxiliary file "meas.asc", use:

   smartreader -input meas.out -auxfile meas.asc -output outfile
