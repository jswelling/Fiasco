    <h1>make_group_anat.csh</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  make_group_anat.csh finds unweighted group means of several common
  anatomical datasets: axial, inplane, stripped axial, and stripped
  inplane scans.

  make_group_anat.csh [-m namemap] [-d key=value] subj1 subj2 ...

    -m namemap uses the specified mapfile (along with defaults in
       F_MAP_PATH) to find subject directories.  Multiple -m
       options may be used.
    -d key=value defines the given additional key-value pair

  or

  make_group_anat.csh -help [topic]

  All of the subjects must have been transformed into the same
  coordinates, presumably Taliarach space.

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  This script uses map_name.py to find the anatomical datasets
  associated with the file names Axial, StrippedAxial, Inplane,
  and StrippedInplane (the association being defined by map_name.py's
  name mapping tables).  Unweighted means are constructed for all
  of the subject datasets which are found; those not found are simply
  excluded from the means.  The output dataset names will be mean_Axial,
  mean_StrippedAxial, mean_Inplane, and mean_StrippedInplane.  These
  files are created in the directory from which make_group_anat.csh
  is run.  If no subject has a dataset of a given type, no mean map 
  for that type will be produced.
