<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  mri_printfield.c is used to print out the contents of one field from 
  a Pittsburgh MRI dataset.

  To run mri_printfield use:
    mri_printfield [-field Field] [-nofail] [-verbose] [-wildcard]
 	   infile

  or:
    mri_printfield -help [topic]

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>field</h3>
<pre>
  [-field Field]			(-fld Field)

     Specifies the MRI key field string name to extract and print.
     The string may include the wildcard characters '*' (matches
     any string) and '?' (matches any single character) if the 
     -wildcard flag is set.  The default field is "images.dimensions"

</pre>
<h3>nofail</h3>
<pre>
  [-nofail]				(-nof)

     Specifies that if the given field is not present, mri_printfield
     should write a blank line and exit normally.  In the absence of
     this flag, a request for a missing field causes an error exit.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>
  [-verbose]				(-ver|v)

     Specifies verbose output.  This produces key-value pairs in the
     form "&lt;key&gt; = &lt;value&gt;" rather than simply emitting the value.

</pre>
<h3>wildcard</h3>
<pre>
  [-wildcard]				(-wld)

     Specifies that the field string may contain wildcard characters.
     The character '*' matches any string, and the character '?'
     matches any single character.  There is no escape mechanism
     for wildcards, so for example it is impossible to search for
     an exact match for the character '?' if the -wildcard flag is
     set.  The syntax supports only a single instance of '*' in the
     field.  Don't forget that the shell will try to match these
     characters against filenames if they aren't protected, for
     example by wrapping the string in single quotes.

</pre>
<h3>infile</h3>
<pre>
  infile

  Ex: Printfield_file

  The value of infile specifies the input dataset. This argument is required.
