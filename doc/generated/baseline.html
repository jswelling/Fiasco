<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  baseline is used to correct for miscalibration of the
  analog-to-digital converter. It can also be used to reverse lines,
  as needed for standard EPI data collection.  Raw and smoothed
  correction estimates are saved; see "smoother options" below for
  further details.

  To use baseline use:
    baseline [-estimates Estimates-File]
             [-smoothedestimates Smooth-Est-File] [-reverse Which-Lines]
             [...smoother options...] infile outfile

  or:  
    baseline -help

</pre>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>

  baseline infile outfile

  This use takes all the defaults:
  -est rawbaseline.par
  -sme baseline.par
  -rev odd

  baseline -est baseline.par -sme sm.par -rev even infile outfile

  This use puts the raw parameter estimates in file baseline.par (at 
  odds with the default use) and puts the smoothed parameter estimates
  in file sm.par.  Line reversal is for even lines only (typical for
  coronal slices).

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>estimates</h3>
<pre>
  [-estimates Estimates-File]      (-est Estimates-File)

  Ex: -e b.par

  Specifies that the location adjustment parameters should be written
  to Estimates-file. Default is "rawbaseline.par".

</pre>
<h3>smoothedestimates</h3>
<pre>
  [-smoothedestimates Smooth-Estimates-File]      (-sme Smooth-Estimates-File)

  Ex: -sme sb.par

  Specifies that the smoothed location adjustment parameters should be
  written to Smooth-Estimates-file. Default is "baseline.par".

</pre>
<h3>reverse</h3>
<pre>
  [-reverse even|odd|all|none]            (-rev|-r Which-Lines)

  Ex: -r all

  Specifies the lines whose order is to be reversed.
  Values of Which-Lines accepted:
       "none"      No line reversing.
       "odd"       Odd lines are reversed.
       "even"      Even lines are reversed.
       "all"       All lines are reversed.
  The default is to use any row flipping information in the input
  dataset, or "none" if no such information is available.


</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<pre>

  Baseline accepts only standard complex-valued images with dimension
  order "vxyzt" or "vqyzt" as input.

  The outfile is not allowed to have the same name as the infile.

  The outfile consists of single-precision, complex-valued, floating-point
  numbers.

  The location adjustment parameters are written in ASCII format with
  each line containing the real and the imaginary parts parameters.
  The lines occur in "zt" dimension order.

  Odd line reversing is typical for axial and sagittal slices; even
  line reversing is typical for coronal slices.

</pre>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<pre>

  Baseline adjustment is based on the fact that the k-space data
  should (approximately) be oscillating around 0 at the highest frequencies.

  Implementation calculates the mean of the k-space data at the
  highest frequencies, in particular the left and right
  quarters of k-space (where the kx-dimension corresponds to the
  left/right axis).

  Estimates are subject to noise, so the time series for each slice
  is smoothed.  The smoothed value at each time is subtracted from all
  of the k-space data for that time.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>SmootherOptions</h3>
<pre>

    -smoother_type type

       type specifies smoother type. Available options are:

              "gauss" for Gaussian kernel smoothing
              "tri"   for triangular kernel smoothing
              "pow"   for power law kernel smoothing 
              "median"for median smoothing
              "none"  to disable smoothing  
              "ddx"   a special type which produces output values equal 
                      to the change in the input from the previous sample
              "shift" a special type which produces output values equal 
                      to the input values at some nearby cell
              "linterp" a special type which produces output values which
                      are linearly interpolated between adjacent inputs
              "runningsum" a special type which produces output values equal 
                      to the previous output value plus the
                      corresponding input value

    -smoother_bandwidth band

       band (a floating point number) specifies the bandwidth used
            in smoothing.  The meaning of bandwidth depends on the
            type of smoothing used;  see below.

    -smoother_threshold thresh

       thresh (a floating point number) specifies the cutoff threshold
            for the smoothing kernel.  If a point within the smoothing
            window differs from the point being calculated by a value
            greater than the threshold, the window is truncated before
            that value on that side.  If thresh is &lt;= 0.0, this test
            is not performed and the window is not truncated.

    -smoother_k k

       k (a floating point number) specifies a constant which may be
            used in specifying the smoothing kernel.  No current 
            smoother type actually uses this value; it is present for
            future expansion.

  Unless otherwise specified for a specific function, the default type
  is Gaussian, the default bandwidth is 45.0, the default constant is 
  60.0, and the default threshold is 0.0.

</pre>
<h2>SmootherCalculation</h2>
<pre>

  All kernel smoothers check for missing data points, and exclude them. 

  Kernel smoothers perform the following operations at each point
  to be smoothed.  First, a smoothing window is defined.  This
  window initially includes all of the data points.  The window is 
  then truncated using the threshold value if appropriate.  A weighted
  sum of the points remaining in the window is then calculated,
  excluding missing points.  This value is divided by the sum of the 
  weights to produce the smoothed value for the point in question.
 
  The weights used are defined by the kernel K(t), where t= x1-x2, the
  separation between the points in question.  The kernels used by the
  various kernel smoothers are:

  Gaussian:   K(t)= exp( -(t*t)/(bandwidth*bandwidth) ) 


                    1.0 - (abs(t)/bandwidth) if abs(t)&lt;=bandwidth/2
  Triangular: K(t)= 
                    0.0 otherwise
                    

  Power law:  K(t)= pow( C, abs(t) )  where C= pow(0.5,1/bandwidth), 
                                      so that bandwidth is full width
                                      at half maximum.

  Smoother type "median" replaces the input value with the median
  value in a window of total width equal to bandwidth.  "median"
  k values but respects thresholds.

  Smoother type "none" does no smoothing, simply copying its input to
  its output.

  Smoother type "ddx" produces output Y[i]= X[i]-X[i-1].  This is a
  convenient hack when derivatives are needed.  "ddx" ignores
  bandwidth, threshold, k, and all "missing" information.

  Smoother type "shift" produces output Y[i]= X[i+shift], where 
  shift=rint(bandwidth).  (rint rounds to the nearest integer).
  Values for which X[i+shift] would fall outside the range of the
  input data are set to 0.0.  "shift" ignores threshold, k, and all
  "missing" information.

  Smoother type "linterp" produces output Y[i]= (X[i-1] + X[i+1])/2
  for all i which do not lie on the boundary of the input data range.
  At the boundaries, 2-point extrapolative values are used.  For
  example, Y[0]= 2*X[1] - X[2].

  Smoother type "runningsum" produces output Y[0]= X[0], and
  Y[i]= Y[i-1]+X[i] for all i&gt;0.
