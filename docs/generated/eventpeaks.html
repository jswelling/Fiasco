<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

   Eventpeaks takes a pgh MRI dataset containing event data
   and creates a new MRI file containing a chunk with a ramping
   function corresponding to the event peaks in the original file.
   Specifically, the output file values run linearly from 0.0
   immediately following one marker up to the number of time points
   before the next one.  The output has dimension vt where the extent
   of t is the number of samples and the extent of v is the number of
   unique event markers.  Estimates are made for the values before 
   and after the first and last peaks.  The input chunk must be a 
   pure time series; that is, its dimensions must be "t" or all other
   dimensions must have a length of 1.
 
   The command line for eventpeaks is:
     eventpeaks [-chunk chunk] [-window window_size] [-threshold threshold] 
 	 [...smoother options...] infile outfile

   or:
     eventpeaks -help

</pre>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>

   eventpeaks infile outfile

   This use takes all the defaults:
 -c   physio
 -win 20
 -thr 200

   eventpeaks -c images -win 40 -thr 150 infile outfile

   This use reads the data from the images chunk with a window of 40
   and a threshold of 150.
 

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>chunk</h3>
<pre>
   [-chunk chunk]	(-chu|c chunk)
 
   Ex: -c chunk1

   Specifices the name of the chunk to use. The default value is
   "physio."

</pre>
<h3>window</h3>
<pre>
   [-window window_size]	(-win window_size) 

   Ex: -win 9  

   Specifies the size of the window to use for filtering the data when
   looking for peaks. The default value is 20 samples.

</pre>
<h3>threshold</h3>
<pre>
   [-threshold threshold]	(-thr threshold)

   Ex: -thr 20

   Specifies the threshold to use for deciding whether a peak is
   significant or not. The default value is 200.

</pre>
<h3>infile</h3>
<pre>
   infile

   The given value of infile specifies the input dataset. 

</pre>
<h3>outfile</h3>
<pre>
   outfile

   The given value of outfile specifies the file name to which to
   write the output dataset.
