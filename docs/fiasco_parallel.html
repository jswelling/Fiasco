<H2>Parallel FIASCO: A User's Guide</H2>
<P>Parallel FIASCO allows one to use multiple workstations to process MRI datasets
in considerably less time than it would take to perform the same operations
on a single workstation. The prerequisites for using parallel FIASCO are: </P>
<OL>
<LI>The set of workstations you wish to use must share a common file system
(NFS, AFS, etc.) in order that all processes may work within the same directories.
Your home directory should also be on this common filesystem.
<LI>The operating system must support processes on different machines simultaneously
opening a file for writing, where each process indepedently seeks and writes
to different segments within the file. Most UNIX operating system support
this. 
<LI>Since parallel FIASCO is based upon the PVM message-passing package (which
is included with the standard FIASCO distribution), you must first install
PVM. It is easiest to install PVM somewhere on the common filesystem. You
can do this by untarring <TT>pvm.3.3.11.tar</TT> and following the installation directions in the <TT>Readme</TT> file.
<LI>Make sure that <TT>$PVM_ROOT/lib</TT> is set to be on your <TT>$PATH</TT> within your <TT>.cshrc</TT>.
</OL>
<P>To actually run a FIASCO job in parallel, you should do the following things: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Set <TT>F_PARALLEL_HOSTS</TT> to the set of machines that you wish to use. The current machine on which
you are starting things up is implicitly included in this list, so you don't
have to include its name. Example: 
<PRE>
setenv F_PARALLEL_HOSTS &quot;revenge.stat.cmu.edu alarm.stat.cmu.edu&quot;
</PRE>
<P>If some of the machines are multiprocessors and you want to run more than
one 
process on them, you may optionally supply a process count after the name.
Example: </P>
<PRE>
setenv F_PARALLEL_HOSTS &quot;hydra.psy.cmu.edu:6&quot;

</PRE>
<P>This will start 6 worker processes on hydra. </P>
<LI>Set <TT>F_PARALLEL</TT> to 1 to enable parallelism. Currently, <TT>deghost</TT>, <TT>recon</TT>, <TT>sgrid</TT>, <TT>srecon</TT>, <tt>baseline</tt> and <TT>estireg</TT> are the only programs that will run in parallel. However, these usually
account for the bulk of the processing time for a dataset. 
<LI>Now, run FIASCO as you normally would for a single workstation. If you want
to disable parallelism for subsequent runs, you can simply &quot;<TT>unsetenv F_PARALLEL&quot;</TT>, or &quot;<TT>setenv F_PARALLEL 0&quot;.</TT>
