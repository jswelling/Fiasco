<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  outlier is used to identify and "pull in" outliers

  outlier [-input Input-header-file] [-headerout Output-header-file]
          [-dataout Output-data-file] [-parameters Parameter-file]
          [-cutoff Stdvs] [-badimage Proportion]
          [-mean mean-header-file | -median median-header-file ]
          [-stdv stdv-header-file | -iqr iqr-header-file ]

  outlier -help [topic]

  Command Line Options (see Usage:flag)

  -help   Engage help system, providing help on topic, if supplied,
            or starting the interactive help system otherwise.

</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>

  -input Input-header-file        (-i Input-header-file)

     Specifies that the header for the input dataset is located
       in Input-header-file.
     Default value is "input.mri".
     Input-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
       as Output-header-file.

     outlier.m accepts only standard real- or complex-valued images
       with dimension order "vxyzt" or "xyzt" as input.

</pre>
<h3>headerout</h3>
<pre>

  -headerout Output-header-file  (-h Output-header-file)

     Specifies that the header for the output dataset should
       be written to Output-header-file.
     Default value is "outlier.mri".
     Output-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
       as Input-header-file.

</pre>
<h3>dataout</h3>
<pre>

  -dataout Output-data-file      (-d Output-data-file)

     Specifies that the output data should be written to Output-data-file.
     Default value is ".dat".

     The output dataset will consist of single-precision, floating-point
       values of the same vector length as the input dataset.

</pre>
<h3>parameters</h3>
<pre>

  -parameters Parameter-file     (-p Parameter-file)

     Specifies that the counts of identified outliers should be written
       to Parameter-file.
     Default value is "outlier.par".

     The counts of identified outliers are written in ASCII in "zt"
       dimension order.

</pre>
<h3>cutoff</h3>
<pre>

  -cutoff Stdvs                  (-c Stdvs)

     Specifies the minimum number of standard deviations that a value
       must be from the mean to be identified as an outlier.  Note
       that this value is always specified in standard deviations,
       even if -iqr is specified (see below).
     Default value is 3.5.

</pre>
<h3>badimage</h3>
<pre>

  -badimage Proportion           (-b Proportion)

     Specifies that any image whose proportion of pixels declared as
       outliers is higher than Proportion shall be declared missing.
     Default value is 0.02.

</pre>
<h3>mean</h3>
<pre>

  -mean mean-header-file

     Specifies an *input* file containing mean values to be used in
       place of the computed means in the outlier calculation.  This
       flag is equivalent to the "median" flag.
     The default is to use computed means.

</pre>
<h3>median</h3>
<pre>

  -median median-header-file

     Specifies an *input* file containing median values to be used in
       place of the computed means in the outlier calculation.  This
       flag is equivalent to the "mean" flag.
     The default is to use computed means.

</pre>
<h3>stdv</h3>
<pre>

  -stdv stdv-header-file

     Specifies an *input* file containing standard deviation values to 
       be used in place of the computed standard deviations in the 
       outlier calculation.  This flag and the -iqr flag are mutually
       exclusive.
     The default is to use computed standard deviations.

</pre>
<h3>iqr</h3>
<pre>

  -iqr iqr-header-file

     Specifies an *input* file containing interquartile range values
       to be used in place of the computed standard deviations in the 
       outlier calculation.  These values are scaled by the program to
       produce estimates of the standard deviation, based on a normal
       distribution.  This flag is mutually exclusive with -stdv.
       Note that -cutoff is always specified in standard deviations!
     The default is to use computed standard deviations.

</pre>
<h2>Calculation</h2>
<pre>

  For real-valued datasets, simple means and standard deviations are
    calculated on a pixel-wise basis.  Then, if any particular pixel
    lies further than Stdvs standard deviations from the mean, it is
    identified as an outlier, and its value is changed to equal the
    mean plus/minus Stdvs standard deviations for high/low outliers,
    respectively.

  For complex-valued datasets, means and standard deviations are
    calculated on a pixel-wise basis, for the real and imaginary
    portions separately.

  By first finding the median image and IQR image of the input dataset
    and supplying those values via the -median and -iqr flags, the
    user can avoid the sensitivity to extreme values in the
    calculation of the mean and standard deviation.
