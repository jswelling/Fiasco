  -observation obsMatrix                    (-obs obsMatrix)

  Specifies the observation matrix (required input).  This is a
  rank 2 matrix, possibly varying with slice and time, with extents
  equal to that of the hidden state and the observation.  See the
  FileStructure section below for details.

</pre>
<h3>proccov</h3>
<pre>
  -proccov procCovMatrix                    (-pcv procCovMatrix)

  data is not saved.  See the FileStructure section below for details.

</pre>
<h3>xOut</h3>
<pre>
  [-out xOut]

  Estimated values of the hidden time series values (output).  This is
  the estimated hidden state.  If this parameter is not specified,
  estimates of the hidden state are not saved.  See the FileStructure
  section below for details.

</pre>
<h3>zIn</h3>
<pre>

  Input time series data file to be filtered (required input).  This
  is the time series of observations.  See the FileStructure section
  below for details.  NOTE that time k of transMatrix contains the
  transition matrix traditionally subscripted (k-1), while time k of
  zIn contains the observation traditionally subscripted k.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>FileStructure</h3>
<pre>

  The matrix operations which implement the Kalman filter imply a set
  of relationships between the dimensions of the various input and 
  output files.  This section describes those relationships.

  Recall that the leftmost dimension of a Pgh MRI dataset varies
  fastest, while matrix elements are traditionally labeled in
  row-column order in matrix algebra.  This means that the Pgh MRI
  dataset corresponding to a matrix will have data elements ordered
  like the transpose of the matrix.  For example, suppose that the
  matrix elements F00 through F22 of a 3x3 matrix are stored in
  Pgh MRI files of the same names.  One could assemble the appropriate
  matrix F with the commands:

    mri_paste -d s -out F F00 F10 F20 F01 F11 F21 F02 F12 F22
    mri_remap -order ab -len 3:3 F

  Assume that zIn has dimensions aXzt, where X is any combination
  of letters, and that the extent of a is L.  The dimensions X and z
  enumerate the voxels in the input dataset; each voxel is filtered
  separately.  The program will iterate the Kalman filter a number of
  times equal to the extent of t.

  The dimension string for obsMatrix must be either two characters or
  four characters; if the string is four characters long the last two
  must be zt in that order.  The second dimension must match the first
  dimension of zIn in name and extent, so for the current example
  it must be a and have extent L.  The first dimension may be any
  unique character.  For the sake of this example, assume it is b and
  that it has extent M.  M will be the dimensionality of the hidden
  state of the Kalman process.

  The dimension string of transMatrix must be either two characters or
  four characters; if the string is four characters long the last two
  must be zt in that order.  The first two dimensions must have the
  same extent, and that extent must be M, the extent of the second
  dimension of obsMatrix.  Remember that the leftmost index in a Pgh
  MRI datafile varies fastest, and that this is contrary to the
  convention for writing down algebraic matrices.  Thus the sequence
  of values in transMatrix is the same sequence (reading left-right
  then up-down) as that in the transpose of the transition matrix as
  it is usually written algebraically.

  If the last two dimensions of obsMatrix and/or transMatrix are zt in
  that order, they must match the corresponding dimensions in zIn
  in extent.  In this situation the corresponding matrix can be made
  to vary by slice and time.  If the last two dimensions are not zt, a
  constant matrix will be used for all times.  Varying the matrixes by
  voxel is not supported.

  The procCovMatrix and obsCovMatrix inputs must have two-character
  dimension strings, and the extent of both dimensions must match the
  corresponding values of transMatrix and obsMatrix respectively.
  Thus for the current example, the extent of both dimensions for
  procCovMatrix must be M and the extent of both dimensions for
  obsCovMatrix must be L.  Varying these quantities by time (with
  additional dimensions zt) is not supported.

  The output dataset xOut will contain a chunk with dimensions
  matching zIn, except that the extent of the first dimension will
  be M.  xOut will contain no 'missing' chunk, even if zIn contains
  one.

  The error covariance output errCovOut will only be produced if it is
  specified on the command line.  If so, it will have dimensions
  matching those of xOut, with an additional leading dimension of
  extent M and all in-plane dimensions set to extent 1.  (Since the
  error covariance does not depend on the sample data it does not vary
  by sample).  errCovOut will contain no 'missing' chunk, even if zIn
  contains one.

  The log likelihood output logLikelihoodOut will only be produced if
  it is specified on the command line.  If so, it will have dimensions
  matching those of xOut, but with the leading dimension and the t
  dimension both having extent 1.  logLikelihoodOut will contain no
  'missing' chunk.

<h3>Details</h3>

  This discussion follows "An Introduction to the Kalman Filter" by
  Greg Welch and Gary Bishop, with some minor modifications including
  time dependence for the process matrix A and measurement matrix H.  
  See <a href=http://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/kalman>The Kalman Filter<a>
  for this document and many others.

  mri_kalman performs the iterations of the Kalman filter, solving
  the linear stochastic difference equation:

   x  = A   x  +  w
    k    k-1 k-1   k-1

   z  = H x  + v
    k    k k    k

  where the process noise w and observation noise v are assumed to be
  white and independent with normal probability distributions

   p(w) = N(0, Q)

   p(v) = N(0, R)

  for covariance matrices Q and R.  The current implementation does
  not support varying Q and R between iterations.  Thus while the
  following description carries the subscripts of Q and R, in the
  implementation both are constant for all k.

  The variables involved and their corresponding datasets are as
  follows.  (Matrix dimensions are for a single sample).
 

     variable   dataset          matrix dims     conventional name

       K          (none)             MxL           Kalman gain

       Q        procCovMatrix        MxM           process covariance

       R        obsCovMatrix         LxL           observation covariance

     (none)    logLikelihoodOut      1x1           log likelihood

  In the notation that follows, a karat (^) denotes the expectation
  value of a quantity.  A minus sign superscript denotes a Bayesian
  prior; for example:

     -
    P  = (prior estimate of P at time k) 
     k

       = (estimate of P at time k given k-1)

       = P
          (k|k-1)

  The steps performed are as follows.  First, 'prior' estimates are
  calculated at time k based on data at time k-1:

    ^-        ^
    x  = A    x
     k    k-1  k-1

     -            T
    P  = A   P   A     +  Q
     k    k-1 k-1 k-1      k-1

  where T denotes the matrix transpose.  Posterior estimates are then 
  calculated at time k:

           -  T      -  T       -1
    K  =  P  H [ H  P  H  +  R ]
     k     k  k   k  k  k     k

    ^     ^-              ^-
    x  =  x  + K ( z  - H x  )
     k     k    k   k    k k

                     -
    P  = ( I - K  H ) P
     k          k  k   k

  At this point the process repeats, calculating priors for time k+1
  via the expressions above.  Note that the values at time k are
  calculated based on the value of the matrix A at time k-1; this
  implies that the first input value for A is from the time step
  before that of the first input for z.

  The log likelihood is calculated as the sum over all times of 
  contributions dL at time k, where:

         -1             L         -  T        
    dL = --- log{ (2 pi)  det( H P  H  + R ) } 
      k   2                     k k  k    k                       

           1         ^  T      -  T       -1         ^
        - ---( z - H x )  ( H P  H   + R )   ( z - H x )
           2    k   k k      k k  k     k       k   k k

  In this expression det() denotes the matrix determinant and pi is 
  of course 3.1415...

  NOTE that because the k'th value of A provided in the transMatrix
  input dataset gives the value of A at time k-1, while the k'th
  values of the quantities in all other datasets give their values at
  time k.  This is a result of the convention that the first A used in
  the Kalman iteration is identified with time k-1.
                                                                 ^
  The first step of the iteration also requires values for P and X at
  time k-1.  The following initial values are used:


     P   = Q
      k-1

     ^                  T
     x   = ( 1 1 1 ... )      (that is, a vector of 1's)
      k-1

  Missing information in the ZIn file is applied if present; the
  Kalman weight is set to zero for missing input data.  Because of the
  definition of the missing data chunk, missing information must
  change only by slice and by time.  Missing information in other
  input files is ignored.
