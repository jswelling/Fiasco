    <h1>merge_detrend.csh</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  merge_detrend.csh uses brute force alignment and concatenation 
  to merge several Fiasco runs, assumed to be in subdirectories of 
  the current directory. 

    merge_detrend.csh dir1 dir2 ...

  or

    merge_detrend.csh -help [topic]

  Note that versions of fiasco.local.csh and epi.local.csh must be 
  present in the current directory;  see Environment below.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  The steps performed by merge_detrend.csh are:

  1) Find the 3D rotation and translation needed to align the Mean_1
     dataset for each of the input directories to that of the first
     input directory.

  2) Produced aligned versions of each of the statistics files, 
     with the orientation of the first directory as the standard.

  3) Produce aligned versions of the detrend files for each
     directory

  4) Produce a concatenated detrend file containing all the aligned
     images over all the directories

  5) Produce a concatenated split file containing all the experimental
     condition information over all the input directories

  6) Produce statistics and plots for the merged dataset just as they
     would normally be produced by Fiasco for a single dataset.

  The assumption is made that the total number of degrees of freedom
  is large enough that a normal distribution can be used in place of 
  a t distribution.

<h2>Environment</h2>
<pre>

  fiasco.local.csh, ${FIASCO}/epi.defaults.csh, and epi.local.csh
  are read by the script to provide values for F_XVOXEL, F_YVOXEL,
  F_ZVOXEL, some standard Fiasco file names, and certain values 
  used by makeps.csh as plot labels. Note that experimental paradigm 
  information from epi.local.csh is not used;  that is taken from the 
  individual runs.
