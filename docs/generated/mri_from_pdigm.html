<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  mri_from_pdigm takes a stream of ascii data as input.  That 
  stream consists of multiple lines, each of which starts with a 
  monotonically increasing float (a time stamp).  This is the
  output format produced by the "dmread" utility when it is used
  with the "-s" option.  mri_from_pdigm reads the stream and
  produces a Pittsburgh MRI dataset in "vt" format containing
  the data.

  To run mri_from_pdigm use:
    mri_from_pdigm [-low Low_Time] -high High_Time 
 	   [-chunk Chunk-Name] outfile

  or:
    mri_from_pdigm -help

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>low</h3>

  earlier values are dropped.  The default value is 0.0.

</pre>
<h3>high</h3>

   -high High_Time

   Specifies the maximum time stamp that will get included;
   later values are dropped.  This argument is required.

</pre>
<h3>chunk</h3>
<pre>
   [-chunk Chunk-Name]			(-chu|c Chunk-Name)

   Specifies that data will be written to chunk Chunk-Name in output
   file.  The default value is "physio".
