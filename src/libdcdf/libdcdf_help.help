*CumulativeDistributionFunctions

  Cumulative distribution functions and their inverses are provided
  by routines from "dcdflib.c", available from the 
  \<a href="http://gams.nist.gov/serve.cgi/Module/RANDOM/DCDFLIB.C/13184/"\>Guide to Available Mathematical Software\<a\>.  This version has
  been slightly modified in packaging, for example changing names like
  cdft() to cdf_t(), reducing the number of external symbols, and
  changes to the routines that provide machine precision information.
