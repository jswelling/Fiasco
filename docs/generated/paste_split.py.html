    <h1>paste_split.py</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  paste_split.py concatentates multiple 'intsplit'-style split files.

   paste_split.py [-v][-d] --out outSplit --nimages dt --nslices dz
      inSplit1 inSplit2 inSplit3 ...

   where:
    -v specifies verbose output
    -d specifies debugging output
    --nslices dz is the number of slices, presumably the same for all
      the input splitfiles
    --nimages dt is the total number of images covered by all the 
      input splitfiles
    --out outSplit is the output splitfile to be created
    inSplit1 and etc. are split files of the type read by 'intsplit'.

  or

   paste_split.py -help [topic]

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  The output split file uses a general form, and thus may not look
  like any of the input split files.  When fed to intsplit, however,
  it describes the same set of conditions, factors, levels, and
  slicewise condition assignments as the input split files.

  Any input slice for which any input factor is unknown ('NA') will
  be marked completely unknown- that is, all of its factors will
  be marked unknown.
