    <h1>mri_complex_to_scalar_help</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  mri_complex_to_scalar takes a complex pgh MRI dataset and generates
  a corresponding scalar dataset.  The output dataset is of type
  float32.

  To run mri_complex_to_scalar use: 
    mri_complex_to_scalar [-rea|-ima|-mag|-pha|-phu] [-chunk Chunk_Name] 
    [-v] infile outfile

  or:
    mri_complex_to_scalar -help

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>real</h3>
<pre>
  [-real]			(-rea)

  -real produces the real component of the input dataset.  Only one of
  [-rea|-ima|-mag|-pha|-phu] may be present at a time.  The default is
  -mag.

</pre>
<h3>i</h3>
<pre>
  [-imaginary]

  -imaginary produces the imaginary component of the input dataset.
  Only one of [-rea|-ima|-mag|-pha|-phu] may be present at a time.
  The default is -mag.

</pre>
<h3>magnitude</h3>
<pre>
  [-magnitude]				(-mag)

  -magnitude produces the magnitude of the input dataset. Only one of
  [-rea|-ima|-mag|-pha|-phu] may be present at a time.  The default is
  -mag.

</pre>
<h3>phase</h3>
<pre>
  [-phase]				(-pha)

  -phase produces the phase of the input dataset.  Phase is reported
  in the range of -PI to PI.  Only one of [-rea|-ima|-mag|-pha|-phu]
  may be present at a time.  The default is -mag.
 
</pre>
<h3>phase_unwound</h3>
<pre>
  [-phase_unwound]			(-phu)

  -phase_unwound produces the unwound phase of the input dataset.
  Note that this operation is ambiguous; if the phase is changing
  rapidly the results may not be what was expected or desired.  Phase
  is unwound only over the first non-trial dimension.  For example on
  a dataset with dimension order vtxyz the phase is unwound over the t
  dimension but starts fresh for each new x, y, or z. Only one of
  [-rea|-ima|-mag|-pha|-phu] may be present at a time.  The default is
  -mag.

</pre>
<h3>chunk</h3>
<pre>
  [-chunk Chunk_Name]			(-chu|c Chunk_Name)

  mri_complex_to_scalar will operate on the chunk of the given
   name Chunk_Name.  Default is "images."

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>
  [-verbose]				(-ver|v)

  -v requests verbose operation.

</pre>
<h3>infile</h3>
<pre>
  infile

  The input file from which to extract the complex field values

</pre>
<h3>outfile</h3>
<pre>
  outfile

  The output file to which to write the results.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<pre>

  The first dimension of the dataset must be v, which must have an
  extent of 2.

  If the -u (unwound phase) option is selected, at least one other
  dimension must also be present.

  This executable operates on the "images" chunk.
