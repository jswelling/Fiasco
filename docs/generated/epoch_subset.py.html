<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  epoch_subset.py assembles its output from arbitrarily-placed blocks
  of its input.

    epoch_subset.py [-v] [--debug] --dim a --newdim b --len aExtent 
                    --offsetfile offsetFname inFname outFname

  where:

   -v specifies verbose output
   --debug specifies debugging output 
   --dim a specifies that the input file dimension a will be split,
     so that the corresponding output file dimensions will be 'ab'
     where b is specified by --newdim
   --specifies the 'block dimension'
   --len aExtent specifies the length of the blocks read from the
     input file.  This also serves as the extent of the split 
     dimension in the output file
   --offsetfile gives the name of a file containing offsets for
     the blocks, as ascii integers one per line
   inFname is the name of the input Pgh MRI file
   outFname is the name of the output Pgh MRI file

  or

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>

  Suppose you have a file called 'file1' of dimensions 'abc', with 
  extents 7:5:3, and a text file called 'epochs.txt' with the values 
  1, 2, 3, and 4 on separate lines. You could use the epoch_subset.py 
  command to split the second dimension of the input file, as follows:

    epoch_subset.py --dim b --newdim d --len 2 --offsetfile epochs.txt 
      file1 file2

  (all on one line, of course).  The output file 'file2' would have
  dimensions abdc with extents 7:2:4:3.  It is made up of runs of 
  14 ( =7*2 ) contiguous values from 'file1'.  There are a total of
  12 ( =4*3 ) such runs.  The first starts at an offset of 1 from 
  the beginning of 'file1', because that is the first value in the
  text file of offsets.  Likewise the second run starts from an offset
  of 2, and mostly uses values from 'file1' which overlap those used
  by the first run.  The third and fourth runs begin at offsets 3 and 4.

  After the first 4 runs, however, things change a bit.  The next set
  of 4 runs is taken from the next block of b values, those for which
  the c dimension is 1 rather than 0.  That block begins at position
  35 ( =7*5 ) within 'file1'.  Thus the second set of runs begin at
  offsets 36 ( =1+35 ), 37 ( =2+35 ), 38, and 39.  After that comes
  the next set of 4 runs, beginning at 71 ( = 1+(2*35) ), 72, and etc.

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  There is no requirement that the input blocks be disjoint, or in
  any particular order.

  This script is implemented using mripipes, and so will do its work
  at the speed of a compiled executable.
