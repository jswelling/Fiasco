------ README file for the Fiasco fMRI analysis package ------

Fiasco provides a number of tools for reconstruction, noise
reduction, and statistical analysis of functional MRI data.
Full documentation and installation instructions are available 
from the Fiasco home page,

 http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fiasco

Mail regarding Fiasco should be sent to:

 fiasco@stat.cmu.edu

The short form of the installation instructions is:

1) Install the package FFTW, and optionally PVM or MPI 
   and R or SPlus.  If your system does not already have a 
   collection of LAPACK and BLAS numerical routines, install 
   those also.

2) Run the "configure" script to create a config.mk file.  This
   file contains information about where things are to be found on
   your system; it is easy to edit if "configure" does not find
   the components you wish to use.  config.mk.sample contains a
   sample of a fully specified config.mk file.  "configure --help"
   will show options for the "configure" script.

3) Type "make depend"

4) Type "make"

Fiasco should then build.  If ARCH is the machine architecture
(which you can see with the command "src/fiat_scripts/fiasco_getarch.csh"),
the executables and scripts are created in the directory bin/$ARCH .

It is customary to define the environment variable FIASCO to point to
the directory of executables, and add $FIASCO to your path.

See the web page for further details and cautions.
