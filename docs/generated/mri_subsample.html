<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  mri_subsample takes a pgh MRI dataset of any type, and outputs
  a dataset of the same type containing subsampled data.
  The subsampled data spans the range of one of the dimensions
  of the input data, but has a smaller extent than that of
  the input dimension.  The output data is calculated by dividing
  the input data up into zones, one zone per step in the output
  extent.  Each zone thus contains one or more input data values.
  The output value for the zone is calculated by one of several
  methods;  see below.  The subsampling operation acts on all 
  chunks in the dataset.

  To run mri_subsample use:
    mri_subsample -dimensions Dim -length Length [-window Window] 
 	  [-shift Shift] [-base base] 
 	  [-min | -max | -mean | -sum | -count | -closest | 
 	  -median | -q1 | -q3 | -iqr] 
 	  [-verbose] [-debug] infile outfile

</pre>
<h2>Defaults</h2>
<pre>

  window: 1.0*base
  shift: 0.0
  base: 1
  output zone: max


</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>dimension</h3>
<pre>
  -dimension Dim		(-dim|d Dim)

  Ex. -d t

  Specifies the dimension to be subsampled.  Valid values are one
  character from the dimension string of the input data
  (typically vxyzt).  This argument is required.

</pre>
<h3>length</h3>
<pre>
  -length Length		(-len|l Length)

  Ex. -l 10

  Specifies the output extent of the dimension used in -dimension.

</pre>
<h3>window</h3>
<pre>
  [-window Window]		(-win Window)

  Ex. -win 100

  Specifies the window to be considered within each sampling region.
  This is a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0*base; the
  default is 1.0*base.  window, offset, and base are incompatible with
  the "-closest" method.

</pre>
<h3>shift</h3>
<pre>
  [-shift Shift]		(-shi|s Shift)

  Ex. -s 200

  Specifies the offset of the beginning of the window within the
  sampling region.  This is a floating point number between 0.0 and
  ((1.0*base)-window); the default is 0.0.  window, offset, and base
  are incompatible with the "-closest" method.

</pre>
<h3>base</h3>
<pre>
  [-base Base]

  Specifies a base floating point number by which to divide the window
  and offset; the default is 1.0.  This is useful for scaling for
  times in milliseconds, for example.  window, offset, and base are
  incompatible with the "-closest" method.

</pre>
<h3>max</h3>
<pre>
  -max 

  Specifies that the output should be the maximum in each zone.  The
  min, max, mean, sum, count, median, 1qr, 3qr, iqr, and closest flags
  are mutually exclusive.  Max is the default.  The "missing" chunk is
  treated specially, as described in "Details" below.

</pre>
<h3>min</h3>
<pre>
  -min 

  Specifies that the output should be the minimum in each zone.  The
  min, max, mean, sum, count, median, 1qr, 3qr, iqr, and closest flags
  are mutually exclusive.  Max is the default.  The "missing" chunk is
  treated specially, as described in "Details" below.

</pre>
<h3>mean</h3>
<pre>
  -mean 

  Specifies that the output should be the mean in each zone.  The min,
  max, mean, sum, count, median, 1qr, 3qr, iqr, and closest flags are
  mutually exclusive.  Max is the default.  The "missing" chunk is
  treated specially, as described in "Details" below.

</pre>
<h3>sum</h3>
<pre>
  -sum 

  Specifies that the output should be the sum of all the elements in
  each zone.  The min, max, mean, sum, count, median, 1qr, 3qr, iqr,
  and closest flags are mutually exclusive.  Max is the default.  The
  "missing" chunk is treated specially, as described in "Details"
  below.

</pre>
<h3>count</h3>
<pre>
  -count			(-cnt)

  Specifies that the output should be the number of elements in each
  zone.  The min, max, mean, sum, count, median, 1qr, 3qr, iqr, and
  closest flags are mutually exclusive.  Max is the default.  The
  "missing" chunk is treated specially, as described in "Details"
  below.

</pre>
<h3>closest</h3>
<pre>
  -closest			(-cls)

  Specifies that the output should be the single input datum in each
  zone closest to the output point.  This method is incompatible with
  the window, offset, and base options.  The min, max, mean, sum,
  count, median, 1qr, 3qr, iqr, and closest flags are mutually
  exclusive.  Max is the default.  The "missing" chunk is treated
  specially, as described in "Details" below.

</pre>
<h3>median</h3>
<pre>
  -median			(-med)

  Specifies that the output should be the median value in each zone.
  The min, max, mean, sum, count, median, 1qr, 3qr, iqr, and closest
  flags are mutually exclusive.  Max is the default.  The "missing"
  chunk is treated specially, as described in "Details" below.

</pre>
<h3>1st_quartile</h3>
<pre>
  -1st_quartile			(-1qr)

  Specifies that the output should be the first quartile value in each
  zone.  The min, max, mean, sum, count, median, 1qr, 3qr, iqr, and
  closest flags are mutually exclusive.  Max is the default.  The
  "missing" chunk is treated specially, as described in "Details"
  below.

</pre>
<h3>3rd_quartile</h3>
<pre>
  -3rd_quartile			(-3qr)

  Specifies that the output should be the third quartile value in each
  zone.  The min, max, mean, sum, count, median, 1qr, 3qr, iqr, and
  closest flags are mutually exclusive.  Max is the default.  The
  "missing" chunk is treated specially, as described in "Details"
  below.

</pre>
<h3>inter_quartile</h3>
<pre>
  -inter_quartile		(-iqr)

  Specifies that the output should be the inter-quartile range value
  of the values in each zone.  The min, max, mean, sum, count, median,
  1qr, 3qr, iqr, and closest flags are mutually exclusive.  Max is the
  default.  The "missing" chunk is treated specially, as described in
  "Details" below.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>
  [-verbose]			(-ver|v)

  Ex. -v

  Sets the verbose flag to on, which displays output to the screen
  showing progress.  (-V shows very verbose output.)

</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>
  [-debug]                      (-V)

  Ex. -debug

  Requests debugging output.

</pre>
<h3>infile</h3>
<pre>
  infile

  Ex: detrend

  The value of infile specifies the input dataset. This argument is required.

</pre>
<h3>outfile</h3>
<pre>
  outfile

  Ex: subsampledFile

  The value of outfile specifies the output dataset.  This argument is
  required.


</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  The "missing" chunk is treated specially, as follows.  For min, max,
  mean, sum, and count operations, missing data is excluded from the
  calculation and a given result will be marked *not* missing if *any*
  non-missing input datum contributes to the result.  For the closest
  operation the result is the closest input datum, even if that value
  is missing; the result will be missing if the closest input was missing.

  Chunks not containing the selected dimension are copied verbatim.
  All chunks containing the given dimension will be subsampled.
  (Note that this can give confusing results if the extents of the
  dimension vary between chunks!)  

</pre>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>

  The following will produce a dataset with 30 samples, each
  representing the mean of 1/30th of the input data.  Subsampling
  is done over time.

  mri_subsample -d t -l 30 -mean infile outfile

  Suppose an input dataset has 10000 samples in time, taken at 10ms
  intervals.  The following command will produce a subsampled dataset
  with 10 data values, each representing samples from within a 1000ms
  interval.  The output samples will be taken from the third 100ms
  sub-interval within each 1000ms interval.

  mri_subsample -d t -l 10 -win 100 -s 200 -base 1000 -mean infile outfile</pre>
