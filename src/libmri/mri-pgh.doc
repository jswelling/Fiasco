INTRODUCTION

This document summarizes the proposed format for MRI data within the
Pittsburgh fMRI community.  The intent here was to provide a simple,
extensible format that could be used by various research groups.
Why not use an existing format as a standard?  The more general widely-used
formats such as DICOM are perceived to have too much complexity for a
research effort in which people do not want to devote a large amount of
time learning and conforming to a standard.  On the other hand, the simpler
formats such as ANALYZE are perceived as too limiting to people who want to
include various types of additional information along with the image data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCEPTS

A "dataset" may encompass any number of MRI images plus other information
relevant to those images.  Let us consider a dataset named "example1".

Each dataset has a header which is always stored at the beginning of a file
with extension ".mri".  So the header for dataset "example1" is located in
"example1.mri".  The header holds a set of key/value pairs.  The value
of a key is a string.  For instance, we could have an "acquisition_date"
key with value "15-Dec-95".   Other keys could hold strictly numerical
strings, such as "34".

In the special case where the key's value is "[chunk]", the key points
off to a large chunk of binary data.  These chunks are simply multidimensional
arrays of data.  So we may have an "images" key which points to a
256x256x9x100 array of image data, holding 256x256 resolution images
with 9 slices at each of 100 timesteps.

These binary chunks may be stored in the ".mri" file after the header.
Or they may be directed into other files at the API level.  For instance,
it would not be unusual to keep the "images" data in a file named
"example1.dat".


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FORMAT

Here we describe in detail the file format.  This section may be skipped
by all who intend to just use the provided software interfaces.

The header is written at the beginning of the .mri file and consists of ASCII
characters so that it is human-readable.  The header is basically just
a list of lines of the form "key = value".

The format may be described by the following grammar (a '|' indicates alternative
constructions and a '*' indicates 0 or more repetitions of the starred item):

	<mri-file> := <header>   |
			<header> ^L^Z <binary data>*		# we separate the binary data with ^L^Z
								# to facilitate viewing the file with
								# 'more' and other utilities
	<header> := <key-value-pair>*
	<key-value-pair> := <key> = <value> ^J			# one key/value pair per line

	<key> := <string>					# keys are arbitrary strings; note that
								# case is significant
	<value> := <string>					# values are arbitrary strings;
								# special case: [chunk] indicates
								# that the value is a chunk
	<string> := <an unquoted sequence of non-control
			characters but excluding '='>   |
		    " <a quoted C-style string> "


White space is ignored between elements, but is significant within quoted string values.

KEYS

In order to maintain portability of the files between research
groups, it will be necessary to name keys in a manner that
avoids conflict.  We anticipate that some keys will be fairly
standard and others will be specific to a particular research
project.  We will maintain a list of all commonly used keys
and their interpretation so that duplication and conflicts
are minimized.

The only mandatory keys are "!format" and "!version" keys which
identify the file as a PGH-format MRI dataset.  The '!' prefix
is used to force these keys to be first in the header, since
the header is typically written out with the keys sorted
alphabetically.
	!format = pgh
	!version = 1.0

We reserve some keys in order to specify how binary chunks
are to be interpreted.  We adopt the convention that these keys
are named by concatenating the chunk name with a dot and an
identifying suffix.  For example if we have an "images"
chunk, we will name its properties as follows:

	images.datatype = int16
	images.dimensions = xyzt
	images.extent.x = 64
	images.extent.y = 64
	images.extent.z = 10
	images.file = .dat
	images.order = 0
	images.offset = 0
	images.size = 81920

where:
    images.datatype key may be one of the following:
		uint8		# unsigned 8-bit integer
		int16		# signed 16-bit integer
		int32		# sigend 32-bit integer
		float32		# 32-bit IEEE floating pt number
		float64		# 64-bit IEEE floating pt number
    images.dimensions is a string listing the dimensions of
    	the data within the chunk.  Each character within
	the string gives the name of that dimension and its
	ordering within the chunk data.  The first-named
	dimension is taken to vary most rapidly and the
	last-named dimension least rapidly.
    images.extent.<dimension> gives the number of steps
	along the specified dimension.  If not present,
	there is assumed to be just one step.
    images.little_endian, if present and set to 1, specifies that the
	data is stored in a little-endian format.  The implementation
	will, by default, create chunks with native endian format.
	But by explicitly setting images.little_endian to true or false,
	the user can control the storage representation of the binary data.
    images.file, if present, is the filename where the chunk is located;
	it may be ".<ext>" to indicate a file with the same name but
	different extension, or a full filename.
    images.order is the relative order of the chunk within its
	file; if order is 0, the chunk will be placed first in the file;
	if 1, it will be placed second, etc.; if order is "fixed_offset",
	the offset specifies an absolute location which will not be
	changed even if other chunks are added or removed.
    images.offset is the byte offset specifying the starting location
	within the file.
    images.size is the size of the chunk in bytes.
