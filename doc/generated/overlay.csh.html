    <h1>overlay.csh</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  overlay.csh is designed to replace the deprecated tool "overlay".  
  It is used to threshold a map and overlay the thresholded pixels 
  onto an image

  overlay.csh [-inmap Map-header-file] [-inimage Image-header-file]
          [-headerout Output-header-file]
          [-lowthresh Lower-threshold] [-highthresh Higher-threshold]
          [-mingray Minimum-gray-value] [-maxgray Maximum-gray-value]

  overlay.csh -help [topic]

  Command Line Options (see Usage:flag)

  -help   Engage help system, providing help on topic, if supplied,
            or starting the interactive help system otherwise.

<h2>Arguments</h2>
<pre>

  -inmap Map-header-file         (-inm Map-header-file)

     Specifies that the header for the dataset which contains the
       map to be thresholded is located in Map-header-file.
     Default value is "map.mri".
     Map-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
       as Output-header-file.

     overlay.m accepts only standard real-valued images with
       dimension order "vxyzt" or "xyzt" as input.  The dimensions
       must match those of Image-header-file exactly.

  -inimage Image-header-file     (-ini Image-header-file)

     Specifies that the header for the dataset which contains the
       images onto which to overlay is located in Map-header-file.
     Default value is "input.mri".
     Image-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
       as Output-header-file.

     overlay.m accepts only standard real-valued images with
       dimension order "vxyzt" or "xyzt" as input.  The dimensions
       must match those of Map-header-file exactly.

  -headerout Output-header-file  (-h Output-header-file)

     Specifies that the header for the output dataset should
       be written to Output-header-file.
     Default value is "overlay.mri".
     Output-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
       as Map-header-file or Image-header-file.

  -lowthresh Lower-threshold     (-low Lower-threshold)
                                 (-l Lower-threshold)

     Specifies that all pixels in the mapping dataset which are less
       than Lower-threshold are mapped to 0.
     Default value is -6.0.

  -highthresh Higher-threshold   (-high Higher-threshold)
                                 (-hi Higher-threshold)

     Specifies that all pixels in the mapping dataset which are greater
       than Higher-threshold are mapped to 255.
     Default value is 6.0.

  -mingray Minimum-gray-value    (-min Minimum-gray-value)
                                 (-mi Minimum-gray-value)

     Specifies that the gray-level (unsigned char value) for
       the pixel with minimum value in an image from the
       Image dataset is Minimum-gray-value.
     Default value is 50.

  -maxgray Maximum-gray-value    (-max Maximum-gray-value)
                                 (-ma Maximum-gray-value)

     Specifies that the gray-level (unsigned char value) for
       the pixel with maximum value in an image from the
       Image dataset is Maximum-gray-value.
     Default value is 204.
