<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  ireg3d is used to perform 3-D motion correction on a set
  of images, given estimates of the motion.  If the input images
  are in image space, the specified rotation and translation are
  carried out.  If the input images are in k-space, the rotation
  is carried out and the phases of the result are set such that
  the in-plane translation will be carried out by the FFT that 
  transforms the images to image space. (Scalar data is assumed 
  to be in image space, complex data (v.extent=2) is assumed to be 
  in k-space).  Note that this convention assumes that images are
  acquired slicewise, so that complex data is reconstructed using
  FFTs in the X and Y directions only.  Input data must be organized
  as (v)xyz(t).  It is best to use this algorithm on data that 
  is confined to the central region of the volume;  see the 
  "Calculation" section below for details.  Specifically, applying
  this algorithm to equivalent image space and k space data may
  not produce equivalent results because of these boundary effects.

  To run ireg3d use:
    ireg3d -xvoxel xv -yvoxel yv -zvoxel zv
           [-input Input-header-file] [-headerout Output-header-file]
           [-parameters Registration-parameter-file] [-debug] [-verbose]
           [-real] [-qualmeasure cox|sabs|ssqr|ucell]
           [ -interp fourier|closest|linear|catmullrom|bspline|bezier]
           [-shear4 | -shear7 | -shear13 ]

  or:
    ireg3d -help 

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>xvoxel</h3>
<pre>
   -xvoxel xv                      (-x xv)

   Specifies the voxel edge length in the x direction.  This
   parameter is required.  Only the ratio of this parameter 
   with the other voxel edge length parameters is relevant.

</pre>
<h3>yvoxel</h3>
<pre>
   -yvoxel yv                      (-y yv)

   Specifies the voxel edge length in the y direction.  This
   parameter is required.  Only the ratio of this parameter 
   with the other voxel edge length parameters is relevant.

</pre>
<h3>zvoxel</h3>
<pre>
   -zvoxel zv                      (-z zv)

   Specifies the voxel edge length in the z direction.  This
   parameter is required.  Only the ratio of this parameter 
   with the other voxel edge length parameters is relevant.

</pre>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>
   [-input Input-header-file]        (-i Input-header-file)

   Ex: -input partialk.mri

   Specifies that the header for the input dataset is located
   in Input-header-file. Default value is "input.mri".
   Input-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
   as Output-header-file.

   ireg3d accepts only standard real- or complex-valued images
   with dimension order "vxyzt" or "xyzt" as input.

</pre>
<h3>headerout</h3>
<pre>
   [-headerout Output-header-file]  (-h Output-header-file)

   Ex: -h 3dOutput.mri

   Specifies that the header for the output dataset should
   be written to Output-header-file. Default value is
   "ireg3d.mri. Output-header-file is not allowed to have the same
   name as Input-header-file. 

</pre>
<h3>parameters</h3>
<pre>
   [-parameters Registration-parameter-file]   (-p Registration-parameter-file)

   Ex: -p reg.par
 
   Specifies that the motion correction parameters are to be
   read from Registration-parameter-file. Default value is "reg3d.par".

   The format of the Registration-parameter-file is a series of
   ASCII numbers of the form:
         image# q_x q_y q_z q_w shift_x shift_y shift_z mse
   where the q_ elements compose a unit quaternion specifying
   the rotation.  These 9 numbers must be separated by spaces
   or tabs, but NOT carriage returns- all nine numbers must reside
   on the same line.  The mse entry is ignored;  it is given for
   compatibility with other utilities.  Lines beginning with '#'
   are considered to be comments and are ignored.

</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>
   [-debug]                               [-dbg]
  
   Causes debugging output to be produced.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>
   [-verbose]                              [-v]

   Causes verbose output to be produced.

</pre>
<h3>real</h3>
<pre>
   [-real]

   Set this option if the input data is complex but represents the
   (forward) Fourier transform of a pure real function.  The output is 
   then guaranteed also to represent the Fourier transform of purely
   real data.

</pre>
<h3>shear4</h3>
<pre>
   [-shear4]

   Causes a minimum number of Fourier transforms to be applied.  The
   exact pattern is controlled by the -qualmeasure flag.  Four shear
   operations are used to implement general 3D rotations and
   translations;  some special cases use fewer.  This is the default
   method of implementing the rotation.  This flag is incompatible
   with the -shear7, -shear13, and -trilinear flags.


</pre>
<h3>shear7</h3>
<pre>
   [-shear7]

   Causes a pattern of Fourier transforms to be performed which is 
   symmetrical for small rotation angles.  The exact pattern is 
   controlled by the -qualmeasure flag.  Seven shear operations are
   used to implement general 3D rotations and translations;  some
   special cases use fewer.  This flag is incompatible with the
   -shear4, shear13, and -trilinear flags.

</pre>
<h3>shear13</h3>
<pre>
   [-shear13]

   Causes a fully symmetric series of Fourier transformations to be
   applied.  This means that an odd number of shearing operations
   will be done.  The first will be identical to the last, the second
   will be identical to the second-from-last, etc.  This flag is 
   incompatible with the -shear4, -shear7, and -trilinear flags.

</pre>
<h3>interp</h3>
<pre>
   [ -interp fourier|closest|linear|catmullrom|bspline|bezier]

   Specifies the interpolation mode to be used.  Fourier interpolation
   is the default, and the only interpolation mechanism supported for
   complex data.  See the section below on interpolation methods for
   information on the other options.  The -shear4, -shear7, and
   -shear13 flags are complatible only with Fourier interpolation, and
   the -qualmeasure options effect only Fourier interpolation.

</pre>
<h3>qualmeasure</h3>
<pre>
   [-qualmeasure cox|sabs|ssqr|ucell]

   Sets the method used to calculate the quality measure for a given
   decomposition of a rotation into shears.  This in turn effects 
   which decomposition is chosen for any given rotation.  Valid
   parameters are "cox" (which uses the maximum of the absolute values
   of the shear parameters), "sabs" (which uses the sum of absolute
   values) "ssqr" (which uses the sum of squares of shear
   parameters), and "ucell" (which means a measure of the volume of
   the unit cell which the rotation carries out of the unit cell).
   Default is "ssqr".

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<pre>

  The requested operation is performed using Fourier methods, as
  described below.  Note that the periodic nature of these methods
  means that data carried beyond the edge of the volume will "wrap
  around" and reappear on the other side.  This means that 
  geometrically incorrect results can occur for large rotations
  or translations (typically larger than about 30 degrees' rotation).
  It is best to use this algorithm on data that is confined to the
  central region of the volume.

  For more details on this algorithm, see Eddy, Fitzgerald, Noll ---
  "Improved Image Registration Using Fourier Interpolation", 
  Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 36-6 (Dec 1996)

<h3>CoordinateSystems</h3>
<pre>

  This section describes the 3D coordinate system used by Fiasco.
  The coordinate system is right handed, with the X-Y slices oriented
  according to the "radiological convention".

  As a specific example, consider a set of multi-slice axial scan
  data.  When a slice is viewed, the right side of the image
  corresponds to the patient's left side, and patient's nose is
  at the top of the image.  This amounts to viewing the slice as
  if one were standing at the patient's feet, looking toward the
  head.

  We choose the X axis to be horizontal, with the positive X direction
  toward the image's right (the patient's left).  The Y axis is
  vertical, with the nose pointing in the positive Y direction.  The
  right hand rule then implies that the Z axis points out of the image,
  toward the patient's feet.

  The order of data in a Pittsburgh MRI file representing a scan is
  such that low X values (image left, patient right) appear before 
  high X values (image right, patient left), and low Z values
  (the top of the head) appear before high Z values (slices closer to 
  the patient's feet).  However, note that low Y values (the back of
  the head for an axial scan) appear *after* high Y values (the nose).
  Thus the coordinate system order for the Y direction is reversed
  with respect to the data order.

  With this coordinate system convention (still assuming an axial
  scan), a positive rotation about the X axis corresponds to a nod- 
  the nose moves in the direction of the patient's feet.  A positive
  rotation about Y moves the patient's right ear (on the image's 
  left) in the direction of the feet.  A positive rotation about Z
  brings the nose in the direction of the right ear (on the image's
  left).

<h3>FSHROT3DCalculation</h3>
<pre>

  Fourier Shifts and rotations in 3D are implemented using the 
  "fshrot3d" package.  This package decomposes a requested 
  rotation and translation into three or more shear operations
  in 3D, and implements those shears using 1D Fourier transforms.
  The elementary operations implement a shear, plus a translation
  in the shear direction.

  If the operation is a simple translation (no rotation component),
  three shearing operations implement it- one in each direction.
  Hereafter rotations R may include a translation T.  Pure rotations
  will be denoted by lowercase r, such that 

         R = T r


  If an axis-aligned rotation is requested, three shears are used.
  A fourth shear adds a translation along the rotational axis if
  necessary.
  Specifically, 

         Rz = Sz Sy Sx Sy

  where Rz is a rotation about Z, Sx is a shear in the X direction,
  and etc.  Rotations about other axes can be found by permutation
  of coordinates.

  A non-axis-aligned rotation can be implemented as four shears:

        R = Si Sj Sk Si

  where i, j, and k represent distinct (but not necessarily cyclical)
  axes X, Y, and Z.  There are 3*2*1*1=6 possible such decompositions.
  See Cox et. al., "Real-Time 3D Image Registration for Functional",
  Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 42(1999) or Welling, Eddy, and Young
  (2000) (in preparation) for details.

  The necessary coefficients for these shears are singular or 
  near-singular in some regions, however.  If this situation is
  found to occur, a correcting (pure) rotation "rc" is found which 
  shifts the rotation out of the bad region, and the rotation is 
  implemented as follows (bars denote the conjugate rotation):

        R = T r 
              __
          = T rc rc r

          = Sy Sz Sx Sy Sz Sx Sy
                                  __
  by decomposing ( rc r ) and ( T rc ) each into four shears,
  resulting in 8 shears overall.

  Note that the Fourier methods used here assume that the volume
  being treated is periodic.  As a result of this, if any shear
  carries the "interesting" part of the data beyond the edge of
  the volume, that data will reappear on the opposite edge and
  produce strange artifacts.  Thus this method is best used with
  data confined to the region near the center of the volume, and
  rotation and translation parameters that do not carry that
  data to the boundary.

  If the input data is real or is the Fourier transform of pure real
  data, and one or more of the data dimensions is even, a special
  condition applies.  The phase of the highest frequency signal along
  an even dimension cannot be calculated from the input, so that
  component of the input signal cannot be translated or rotated.

<h3>FFTAlgorithm</h3>
<pre>

  The FFTW package (available from http://www.fftw.org/) is
  used to implement the fast Fourier transforms used in this routine.
  FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) is distributed under
  the Gnu General Public License.

</pre>
<h3>FFTEnvironment</h3>
<pre>

  If the environment variable F_WISDOM_FILE is set, its value will be
  used as the basis for the name of a file in which FFTW will store
  "wisdom".  This is machine-specific information about what precise
  FFT algorithm is fastest on the specific hardware.  This information
  can then be reused, saving a couple of seconds the next time a
  program using FFTW runs.

  Because this information is machine specific, an architecture-
  specific string (usually the same as $PVM_ARCH) is appended to
  the value of F_WISDOM_FILE in forming the filename.

  In parallel runs, FFTW will create one wisdom file per processor,
  by appending processor numbers to the file name.  This is necessary
  to avoid errors due to multiple processes reading and writing the same
  file.





</pre>
<h3>Interpolator</h3>
<pre>

  The Interpolator package supports a number of interpolation
  algorithms.  All are implemented in a 'seperable' fashion, meaning
  that for multi-dimensional interpolation the different dimensions
  are interpolated in separate steps.  Each step interpolates a series
  of samples taken at regular intervals along a grid line.

  <table border cellpadding=5 >
  <caption><b>Characteristics of Interpolators</b>
  <tr><td><b>name</b></td>
        <td><b>N</b></td>
        <td><b>continuity</b></td>
        <td><b>interpolates input pts</b></td>
        <td><b>tension</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>closest</td><td>1</td><td>none</td>
        <td>yes</td><td>no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>linear</td><td>2</td><td>C0</td>
        <td>yes</td><td>no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>catmullrom</td><td>4</td><td>C1</td>
        <td>yes</td><td>0.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>bspline</td><td>4</td><td>C2</td>
        <td>no</td><td>no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>bezier</td><td>4</td><td>C1</td>
        <td>every 3rd</td><td>no</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  N is the number of sample points which contribute to a given output
  value; for example, the output of the "closest" method depends only
  on the value of the nearest input sample.

  Continuity is the number of continuous derivative.  The "closest"
  method produces discontinuous output and thus has no continuous
  derivatives.  The "linear" method performs linear interpolation
  between the nearest two input points, and thus is continuous but
  has no continuous derivatives.

  Note that the "bspline" method is the smoothest with two continuous
  derivatives, but that the price of this is that the input values 
  are not interpolated.  What this means is that if you ask this
  interpolation method to return the values at the locations of the
  input points, the output values will *not* be equal to the input 
  values.  Nevertheless, this is the interpolation method recommended
  by Unser et al. (see below) for implementing rotation with this 
  order of interpolant.

  Methods listed as having a 'tension' support an additional degree
  of freedom corresponding vaguely to the stiffness of a natural 
  spline.  If a tension is supported, the default value is given.
  The specific application in use may or may not support changing 
  this value.
