<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  Warps a normalized brain in the 'MNI Standard' ICBM version of
  Talairach space to roughly match the shape and dimensions of the 
  Talairach version used by AFNI.

  icbm_to_tlrc.py [-v] [-d] [--trilinear|--closest] inDS outDS

   where:
    -v specifies verbose output
    -d specifies debugging output
    --trilinear requests trilinear interpolation, as is appropriate
      for structural images.  This is the default.
    --closest requests closest (zero'th order) interpolation, as is
      appropriate for functional parameter estimates
    inDS is the ICBM-space input file, a 181x217x181 grid
    outDS is the AFNI-space output file, a 161x191x151 grid

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  A pair of affine transformations are used, one for samples above the
  anterior commisure and one for samples below.  The algorithm is that
  described by Matthew Brett in the 14/2/02 version of 
  <a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/Common/mnispace.shtml">http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/Common/mnispace.shtml<a> .  Note
  that the results are approximate!  Neither the MNI nor the AFNI 
  Talairach normalizing transformation accounts for the anatomical 
  variation between subjects, and adding another transformation on 
  top of it will almost surely make matters worse.

  Note that icbm_to_tlrc.py and tlrc_to_icbm.py are not exact
  inverses!  Information is lost at the interface between the
  two affine-transformed regions.  Also, in --closest mode, pixel 
  location rounding leads to small pixel shifts in twice-transformed 
  datasets.  For example, if you start with a dataset in ICBM space, 
  transform to Talairach space, and then transform the result back to 
  ICBM space, some voxels get values which originated 1 voxels away.  
  Also, since the bounds of the ICBM volume are larger than those of 
  the Talairach volume, some ICBM data can be lost around the edges of 
  the data.
