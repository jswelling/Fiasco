<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  coregister_makeps.py produces an image useful for verifying that
  coregistration has been successful.  

  coregister_makeps.py [-v] [-d] --out postscriptFile
                 --func funcDS --strct structDS

    -v requests verbose output
    -d requests debugging output
    --out postscriptFile specifies the name of the Postscript
     output to be produced.
    --func funcDS specifies the name of the coregistered functional
     dataset.  In a standard Fiasco script, this is typically 
     coregistered_func/aligned_GrandMean
    --strct structDS specifies the name of the corresponding
     structural dataset.  In a standard Fiasco script, this is
     typically coregistered_anat/warped_axial_resampled .  The
     structural dataset must occupy the same spatial bounds as
     the functional dataset!

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  This function simply overlays a masked version of the functional
  data on the structural data, with the intention that the user will
  be able to judge whether or not coregistration was successful by
  examining the overlayed Postscript image.  The color parts of the
  output image come from the functional data, while the gray scale
  parts come from the structural.  

  The output shows 3 slices each axial, sagittal, and coronal
  directions.  The slices lie 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 of the way through the
  functional volume in each case.  Note that the bounds of the
  structural image are never tested against those of the functional
  image; it is the user's responsibility to input cobounded datasets.
