# Fiasco
Functional Image Analysis - Computational Olio, plus the Functional Image Analysis Toolkit (FIAT)

_FIAT_ provides a flexible set of tools for manipulating n-dimensional arrays of data on disk.  _Fiasco_ is a set of scripts which use those tools to analyze functional brain imaging data, based on the FIAT tools.

See the [on-line documentation](https://jswelling.github.io/Fiasco/).
