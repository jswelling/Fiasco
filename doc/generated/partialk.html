<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  partialk is used to extend the negative phase direction
    of k-space data which has been collected with all the
    positive phase information but only partial negative
    information.  The result is symmetrized data, with
    equal coverage in the positive and negative phase
    directions.

  partialk [-reverse even|odd|all|none] [-dim nnn]
        -input Input-mri-file -output Output-mri-file

  baseline.m -help [topic]

  Command Line Options (see Usage:flag)

  -help   Engage help system, providing help on topic, if supplied,
            or starting the interactive help system otherwise.

</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>

  -input Input-mri-file        (-i Input-mri-file)

     Specifies that the header for the input dataset is located
       in Input-mri-file.  Default value is "input.mri".
     Input-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
       as Output-mri-file.

     partialk accepts only standard complex-valued images with
       dimension order "vxy(z)(t)" or "vqy(z)(t)" as input.

</pre>
<h3>output</h3>
<pre>

  -output Output-mri-file  (-o Output-mri-file)

     Specifies that the header for the output dataset should
       be written to Output-mri-file.
     Default value is "partialk.mri".
     Output-mri-file is not allowed to have the same name
       as Input-mri-file.

     The output dataset will consist of single-precision, complex-valued,
       floating-point numbers.

</pre>
<h3>dim</h3>
<pre>

  -dim nnn      (-d nnn)

     Specifies that the output data should have a y range of nnn.  The
     given value must be &gt;= half the y range of the input data, and
     &lt;= the y range of the input data.  If this value is not provided,
     the value of the "images.dy_base" tag of the input dataset will
     be used.

</pre>
<h3>reverse</h3>
<pre>

  -reverse even | odd | all | none       (-r even | odd | all | none)

     Reverse even-numbered input scan lines, odd-numbered input scan
     lines, all scan lines, or no scan lines.  The default is to
     use the row flipping information in the input dataset, or "none"
     if no such information is available.

</pre>
<h2>Calculation</h2>
<pre>

  The calculation is based on the fact that a missing value at
    the location (x,y) in a complex image from an MR scanner
    should be nearly equal to the complex conjugate of the
    value at (xmax-x, ymax-y) (adjusted for pixel numbering,
    of course).
