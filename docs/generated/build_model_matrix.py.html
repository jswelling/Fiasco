<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  build_model_matrix.py uses R to produce a design matrix from a Fiasco
  split file and a model equation.

   build_model_matrix.py [-v][-d] --nslices dz --nimages dt
     --out outfile --model 'model equation' [--ordered | --unordered] 
     [--contrasts none|poly|sum|treatment|helmert]
     split1 [split2 [split3 ...]]

  where

    -v specifies verbose output
    -d specifies debugging output
    --nslices dz is the number of slices, presumably the same for all
      the input splitfiles
    --nimages dt is the total number of images covered by all the 
      input splitfiles
    --out outfile is a Pgh MRI file containing the output X matrix.
      It will have dimensions vtz, where the extent of v matches
      the number of matrix columns.
    --model 'model equation' specifies the model equation, for
      example '~ height*weight'.  The model must be specified in
      terms of the factors given in the split file(s).
    --ordered specifies that the factors are to be treated as ordered.
      This is the default.
    --unordered specifies that the factors are to be treated as unordered.
    --contrasts contrastType specifies the type of contrast to be used
      in constructing the design matrix.  For ordered data the options
      are "none" and "sum" ("none" being the default).  For unordered
      data the options are "treatment" and "helmert" ("treatment"
      being the default).
    split1 and etc. are split files of the type read by 'intsplit'.
      If multiple files are given, they are concatenated in time.

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  This script provides an interface between the statistics package R
  and Fiasco.  It runs R as a slave process, translates the
  information in a Fiasco split file into a format R understands, uses
  R to produce a model matrix, and translates the results back to the 
  Fiasco universe.  In principle it should work with SPlus also, but 
  problems in the management of the SPlus slave process prevent this.
  The command to run is taken from the environment variable SPLUS,
  if it is set, and modified appropriately.  If SPLUS is not set the
  command used is 'R --slave --no-save'.

  <b>NOTE</b> that if it did work with SPlus the resulting model matrix
  would not be the same as that produced by R, because the two
  packages use different default methods for factoring the model.

  <b>NOTE</b> also that if you use a model matrix produced with R to perform
  a regression using mri_glm, the results may differ from those which
  R would produce for the same regression.  This is because R uses
  QR decomposition while mri_glm uses SVD decomposition.

  <h4>Handling of the Split File(s)</h4>

  The model formula must be written in terms of the factors specified
  on the second line(s) of the split file(s), and must be written
  in the standard format used by R.  

  If the split file(s) given do not specify experimental conditions
  for the full range of times and slices, the remaining entries will
  be marked missing (NA).  Any conditions which are specified for
  times or slices outside the specified ranges are ignored.

  <h4>Interaction With R</h4>

  A separate R slave process is run and a separate model matrix
  is generated for every slice, because, of course, the model matrix
  can vary by slice.  The actual R instructions used to generate the 
  model matrix are:

    options('na.action'=na.pass)
    ...CONTRASTS SET HERE...
    ...FACTOR DEFINITIONS HERE...
    ...
    df &lt;- data.frame( 'FacName1'=fac1, 'FacName2'=fac2, ... )
    mm &lt;- model.matrix( 'Formula', df )

  where the FACTOR DEFINITIONS lines depend on the factor and
  treatment types. The 'Formula' is of course that specified on the 
  command line, and FacName1 and etc. are the factor names specified 
  by the split files(s). 

  If the --unordered flag is given, or the --ordered flag is given
  (or defaulted) with a treatment type other than "none", the contrast
  types are set via:

    options(contrasts=c('contr.treatment','contr.poly'))

  where 'treatment' and 'poly' are replaced with the unordered and
  ordered contrast methods specified.  Ordered factors are then
  generated with R commands like:

    fac1 &lt;- ordered(c( ...FACTOR VALUES... ),
                    levels=c( ...FACTOR LEVELS... ))

  where '...FACTOR VALUES...' and '...FACTOR LEVELS...' are the
  values and levels specified by the split file(s).  Any
  number of factors can occur; they are numbered sequentially and
  treated as fac1 is in the example.   Unordered factors are generated
  using the factor() function in place of the ordered() function.

  If the --ordered flag is given (or defaulted) and --contrast is set 
  to 'none' (or defaulted), the factors are
  produced with commands like:

    fac1 &lt;- c( ...FACTOR VALUES... )

  which results in a very simple contrast pattern.  In this case,
  factor levels are not explicitly defined.
 
  The values collected from R include the dimensions of the design
  matrix, the elements of the design matrix, and the column names.
  These names are those produced by the R command:

    attr(mm,'dimnames')[[2]]

  If the first of these is '(Intercept)', the associated column of 1's
  is dropped from the design matrix, because mri_glm automatically
  adds an equivalent column.  If the first column label is not 
  '(Intercept)' the first column is not dropped; this can occur if
  the formula given explicitly excludes the intercept.  <b>NOTE</b> that 
  mri_glm will still include an intercept column in this case!

  <h4>Structure of the Output File</h4>

  The labels of the columns are saved in the output file keys of 
  the form 'images.label.v.N' where N is the column number (counting
  from zero).  Thus, for example, one can recover the label for the
  third column with the command:

    mri_printfield -fld images.label.v.2 outfile

  Missing (NA) values in the split file(s) will result in
  corresponding NaN (not-a-number) IEEE floating point values in the
  output dataset.  Note that this is model-dependent.  If some factor
  for a given time and slice has an unknown value but that factor is
  not included in the model, the corresponding matrix element will 
  not be NaN.  The NaN's thus mark missing values in the output
  design matrix.

  To use this design matrix in a run of mri_glm, the corresponding
  data elements must also be marked missing in the 'missing' chunk
  of the input dataset, and the design matrix NaN's must be replaced
  with zeros.  This will cause mri_glm to drop the associated rows
  of the regression.  The NaN design matrix elements must be copied 
  to the 'missing' chunk of the input dataset and replaced with 0's
  in the design matrix itself before the design matrix can be used
  as a factor matrix to mri_glm.
