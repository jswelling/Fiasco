<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  cowarp_inplane.py is used to estimate an affine transformation to
  compensate for distortion between structural and functional Pgh
  MRI datasets.  Its output is a generated shell script which
  can be applied to any statistical Pgh MRI dataset to produce a
  warped version.

  cowarp_inplane.py [-v] [-d] [--oscript scriptName] [--alg algString]
                 GrandMean lowresInplane

    -v requests verbose output
    -d requests debugging output
    --oscript scriptName specifies the name for the output shell
       script which implements the alignment.  The default name
       is "apply_coreg_inplane.gen_csh"
    --alg algString specifies an optimization algorithm.  The
       default depends on the image types of the functional and
       inplane datasets.
    GrandMean  is a functional mean dataset, typically GrandMean
    lowresInplane is a version of the inplane structural dataset
       which has been resampled to match the functional resolution.

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  The script uses the following steps to estimate the aligning
  transformation:

    1) An aligning warp (affine transformation) is
       estimated.
    2) The output shell script is generated.  

  The output shell script can be called as follows:

    apply_coreg_inplane.gen_csh structDS outName

  where apply_coreg_inplane.gen_csh is the (default) script name,
  structDS is a structural dataset (for example anat/inplane),
  and outName is the name of the transformed output dataset.
  The outName dataset has been warped to match the shape of the
  anatomical dataset as closely as possible.  Because the script
  implements a general 3D affine transformation, the input dataset
  can be of any resolution so long as it is aligned with the
  inplane dataset used to estimate the warp.  Because the bounding
  volume of the warped output dataset is considered to be the same 
  as that of the input dataset, the corner coordinates are not changed.

  The algorithm used to estimate the affine transformation is
  specified by the algString command line argument.  The format of
  the algorithm string matches that for the estireg3d command, with
  the addition of these terms:

    "gradmag" : align gradient magnitudes of images rather than
                the images themselves
    "meanc" :   scale images so that mean intensities are equal

  If the --alg algString option is not given, the default depends on 
  whether the functional and inplane datasets are either both
  T1-weighted or both T2-weighted (as determined by the "images.tr" 
  tag in the dataset), or if they differ.  If the weightings match, 
  the default algorithm is "opt=praxis,obj=mse,meanc,inplane".  If they
  differ, the default algorithm is "opt=praxis,obj=jointentropy,inplane".
