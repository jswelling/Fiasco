This directory contains the C libmri library for reading and writing
the Pittburgh MRI format.

A description of the file format is in mri-pgh.doc.

Documentation on how to use the C interface is in mri-c.doc.

To install the package:

1. Decide whether you want to use the mmap routine (default is not to).
   If so, uncomment the #define USE_MMAP line at the beginning of mri.h.

2. If your machine requires ranlib to be run when making a library (most
   no longer do), then remove the '#' from the RANLIB line in the Makefile.

3. Run "make" in the libmri directory.

4. Install the libmri.a library in the appropriate directory on your machine.

That's all there is to it!
