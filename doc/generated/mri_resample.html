<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  mri_resample resamples a Pgh MRI dataset along one dimension,
  producing a new dataset with the same angular alignment as the
  original but with different starting and ending values and voxel
  size in the given dimension.

  To run mri_resample use:

    mri_resample -v -debug -dimension Dimension -length Length 
           -start Start  -end End [-interp interpMode] infile outfile

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>dimension</h3>
<pre>
  -dimension Dimension			(-dim|d Dimension)

  Specifies the dimension to be interpolated.  Valid values are one
  character long; case is ignored.  This argument is required.

</pre>
<h3>length</h3>
<pre>
  -length Length			(-len|l Length)

  Specifies the output extent of that dimension.  This
  argument is required.

</pre>
<h3>v</h3>
<pre>
  [-v]

  Sets verbose output
 
</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>
  [-debug]

  Sets debugging output

</pre>
<h3>start</h3>
<pre>
  [-start Start]

  Specifies the starting coordinate for resampling, given as a
  floating point number in voxels.  The position matching the
  first voxel in the input is 0.0; the position matching the
  last voxel is extent-1 .  Values outside the input bounds are
  permitted.

</pre>
<h3>end</h3>
<pre>
  [-end End]

  Specifies the ending coordinate for resampling, given as a
  floating point number in voxels.  The position matching the
  first voxel in the input is 0.0; the position matching the
  last voxel is extent-1 .  Values outside the input bounds are
  permitted.

</pre>
<h3>interp</h3>
<pre>
  [-interp interpMode]

  Specifies interpolation mode.  Appropriate modes include
  "closest", "linear", "catmullrom", "bspline", and "bezier";
  the default is "linear".

</pre>
<h3>infile</h3>
<pre>
  infile

  Specifies the input dataset.  This argument is required.
    
</pre>
<h3>outfile</h3>
<pre>
  outfile

  Specifies the output dataset.  This argument is required.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<pre>

  Chunks not containing the selected dimension are copied verbatim.

  All chunks containing the given dimension will be resampled.
  (Note that this can give confusing results if the extents of the
  dimension vary between chunks!)  

  If interpolation produces a position outside the boundaries of
  the input dataset, the nearest boundary value is used.

</pre>
<h3>Interpolator</h3>
<pre>

  The Interpolator package supports a number of interpolation
  algorithms.  All are implemented in a 'seperable' fashion, meaning
  that for multi-dimensional interpolation the different dimensions
  are interpolated in separate steps.  Each step interpolates a series
  of samples taken at regular intervals along a grid line.

  N is the number of sample points which contribute to a given output
  value; for example, the output of the "closest" method depends only
  on the value of the nearest input sample.

  Continuity is the number of continuous derivative.  The "closest"
  method produces discontinuous output and thus has no continuous
  derivatives.  The "linear" method performs linear interpolation
  between the nearest two input points, and thus is continuous but
  has no continuous derivatives.

  Note that the "bspline" method is the smoothest with two continuous
  derivatives, but that the price of this is that the input values 
  are not interpolated.  What this means is that if you ask this
  interpolation method to return the values at the locations of the
  input points, the output values will *not* be equal to the input 
  values.  Nevertheless, this is the interpolation method recommended
  by Unser et al. (see below) for implementing rotation with this 
  order of interpolant.

  Methods listed as having a 'tension' support an additional degree
  of freedom corresponding vaguely to the stiffness of a natural 
  spline.  If a tension is supported, the default value is given.
  The specific application in use may or may not support changing 
  this value.

  For a nice treatment of interpolation in the context of rotation,
  see Unser, Thevenaz, and Yaroslavsky, IEEE Transactions on Image 
  Processing, 4.10, 1995

  Computer Graphics Principles and Practice by Foley, van Dam, Feiner,
  and Hughes provides a good introduction to spline curves, including
  the weight functions used by the spline interpolators in this package.
