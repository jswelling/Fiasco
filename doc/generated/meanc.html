<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  meanc is used to coerce all of the images to have
 (approximately) identical means, to adjust for global drifts in
  signal intensity 

  To run meanc use:
    meanc [-input Input-header-file] [-headerout Output-header-file]
          [-dataout Output-data-file] [-parameters Parameter-file]
          [-fixed Fixed-image-number] [-allow_negative_means]

  or:
    meanc -help


</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>
   [-input Input-header-file]        (-i Input-header-file)

   Ex: -i baseline.mri

   Specifies that the header for the input dataset is located
   in Input-header-file. Default value is "input.mri".
   Input-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
   as Output-header-file.

   meanc accepts only standard real- or complex-valued images
   with dimension order "vxyzt" or "xyzt" as input.

</pre>
<h3>headerout</h3>
<pre>
   [-headerout Output-header-file]  (-h Output-header-file)

   Ex: -h meanCorrect

   Specifies that the header for the output dataset should
   be written to Output-header-file.  Default value is "mnadj.mri".
   Output-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
   as Input-header-file.

</pre>
<h3>dataout</h3>
<pre>
   [-dataout Output-data-file]      (-d Output-data-file)

   Ex: -d meanCorrectData

   Specifies that the output data should be written to Output-data-file.
   Default value is the value of headerout with the ".dat" file
   extension. 

   The output dataset will consist of single-precision, floating-point
   values of the same vector length as the input data.

</pre>
<h3>parameters</h3>
<pre>
   [-parameters Parameter-file]     (-p Parameter-file)

   Ex: -p meanParam

   Specifies that the mean adjustment parameters should
   be written to Parameter-file. Default is "mnadj.par".

   The mean adjustment parameters are written in ASCII
   in "zt" dimension order.

</pre>
<h3>fixed</h3>
<pre>
   [-fixed Fixed-image-number]      (-f Fixed-image-number)

   Ex: -f 34

   Specifies that mean adjustments should be done with respect to the
   image numbered Fixed-image-number (C numbering --- i.e. starting
   with 0).  That is, image # Fixed-image-number will be unchanged and
   all other images will be adjusted to match its mean. If image #
   Fixed-image-number is considered missing, the first non-missing
   image following it in the sequence (wrapped around to the beginning
   of the sequence) will be considered the fixed image.
   The default value is 0.

</pre>
<h3>allow_negative_means</h3>
<pre>
   [-allow_negative_means]          (-n)

   If this flag is set, images for which the mean is negative are
   not marked missing.  This never happens with fMRI k-space images
   because the modulus of a complex number is positive by definition,
   but negative means can be reasonable for image-space data.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<pre>

 + The mean adjustment is an image-wide multiplicative adjustment
   which coerces each image to have approximately the same
   mean (modulus) for each image corresponding to a particular
   slice (z-location).
 + For each image, the region over which the mean is calculated
   is the rectangle corresponding to the center one-half of the
   image in both the x- and y-dimensions (i.e. the middle quarter
   of the image).
 + For real-valued images, the mean is a simple average.  For
   complex-valued images, the mean is the average modulus.
 + Let M_f be the mean (modulus) of the fixed image for a particular
   slice, and M_n be the mean (modulus) for image n of the same
   slice.  Then image n is transformed as follows:
   transformed_image_n(x,y) = original_image_n(x,y) * M_f / M_n.
 + Obviously, if M_n is zero (which implies that the image consists
   of only zeroes unless considering non-standard scalar images
   which are allowed to contain negative values), this transformation
   fails.  In this case, the image is set to zero and declared
   missing.
 + If M_n is negative and the -allow_negative_means flag is not set,
   the image is set to zero and declared missing.
