<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  mri_anova takes a pgh MRI dataset of type txyz and information 
  about an experimental design, and produces a number of datasets
  of type xyz containing F statistics for the various design
  parameters.  vt... datasets are also acceptable, so long as
  the vector length of v is 1.  The output datasets are of type float32.

  To run mri_anova use:
    mri_anova [-voxel_address i j k ] [-mse] [-split Split-File] 
       [-condition Condition-File] infile

  or:
    mri_anova -help


</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>voxel_address</h3>
<pre>
   [-voxel_address i j k]		(-vxa i j k)

   Ex: -vxa 32 32 5

   Produces a printed table of statistics for the i,j,k'th voxel of a
   txyz dataset.  Voxel indices count from zero.

</pre>
<h3>mse</h3>
<pre>
   [-mse]      

   Flag that causes a dataset to be written containing the MSE of the fit.
   This option has no effect if -voxel_address is specified.

</pre>
<h3>split</h3>
<pre>
   [-split Split-File]			(-spl Split-File)

   Ex: -split mySplitfile

   The image-by-image split file that is output by the intsplit program. 
   The default value is "newsplit".

</pre>
<h3>condition</h3>
<pre>
   [-condition Condition-File]		(-cnd Condition-File)
  
   The condition file as output by intsplit. The default value is
   "conditions". 

</pre>
<h3>infile</h3>
<pre>
   infile

   Ex: detrend

   The name of the PGH MRI file to be used as input.  This
   parameter is required.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<pre>

   The program's output will depend on factor order if the
   factors are not orthogonal.  

   The number of cross terms generated depends on the value 
   of MAX_SOURCES, a compile-time parameter (generally set to 10).

   If all data for a given voxel are identical, that voxel is
   given an F value of 0.0 in the output files.

   When the -voxel_address option is given, a "factor orthogonality
   measure" is produced.  This value is 1.0 when the factors are
   orthogonal and 0.0 when one factor can be expressed in terms of the
   others.  Specifically, this is the product of the eigenvalues of
   X'X divided by the product of the diagonal elements of X'X, where X
   is the factor matrix and ' denotes transpose.
