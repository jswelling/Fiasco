<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  This script produces pooled mean data from individual condition data
  with included counts and DOF information, of the sort commonly
  produced by the Fiasco "stats" tool.

  pooled_mean.csh [-out outfile] Mean_1 [ Mean_2 ... ]

  or

  pooled_mean.csh -help [topic]

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<pre>

  -out outfile

  ex: -out stat/Mean_all

  specifies the name of the output dataset.  The default is "PooledMean".

  

</pre>
<h2>Calculation</h2>
<pre>

  For Fiasco statistical summary data, the number of counts associated 
  with a value is stored in a chunk named "counts" in the same
  dataset.  Typically the counts value varies over slices but is
  constant within a slice.  This is the format expected by this
  script.

  If M(i) is the mean of some voxel in input file i, and N(i) is
  the corresponding number of counts, the result produced by this
  script is:

               sum( N(i)*M(i) )
     M       = ----------------
      pooled     sum( N(i) )

  where the sums run over all i.

</pre>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>

  To produce a pooled mean from all of the condition means in the
  subdirectory "stat", do:

    pooled_mean.csh -out stat/Mean_all stat/Mean_*.mri
