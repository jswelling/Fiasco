<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  groupcompare.csh takes mean, standard deviation, and count data for
  multiple subjects in two groups in each of two conditions, and
  produces F and P scores for the terms of a random effects model of
  the data.  An overall mean is also produced for convenience in doing 
  overlays, and a data set of total samples per voxel is produced as
  a check that the regions of interest have been well sampled.

  groupcompare.csh [-m namemap] [-d key=value] subj1 subj2 ...

    -m namemap uses the specified mapfile (along with defaults in
       F_MAP_PATH) to find subject directories.  Multiple -m
       options may be used.
    -d key=value defines the given additional key-value pair

  or

  groupcompare.csh -help [topic]

  All of the subjects must have been transformed into the same
  coordinates, presumably Taliarach space.

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  The statistical model used by groupcompare.csh is:

    Y   = M + A  + B  + C  + (AB)   + (BC)   + (AC)   + (ABC)
     ijk       i    j    k       ij       jk       ik        ijk

  where M is the overall mean, 0&lt;i&lt;s identifies the s subjects, 0&lt;j&lt;2
  represents the two groups, and 0&lt;k&lt;2 represents the 2 conditions.
  These terms cover all of the degrees of freedom of the 2*s 
  observations of Y.  This will be a mixed model, with subject being
  a random effect and group and condition being fixed.

  The direct effect of the two conditions is thus:

    Y   - Y    = C - C   + (BC)  - (BC)   + (AC)  - (AC)   
     ij1   ij0    1   0        j1      j0       i1      i0

                + (ABC)    - (ABC)
                       ij1        ij0

  with the other terms cancelling.  Rewriting this equation using 
  lower case to denote differences, 

    y  = m + a + b + (ab)
     ij       i   j      ij

  This forms a two factor mixed effects model, with 'b' (the
  difference of the (BC) terms) being fixed and 'a' random.
  For this model, the relevant test statistics are:

      Factor       Test

        a        MSa/MSE   (random)

        b        MSb/MSab  (fixed)

       (ab)      MSab/MSE  (random)

  (see "Applied Liner Statistical Models" by Neter et al, chapter 24).
  Note that these summed squares apply to the subtracted model, not
  the original model.

  The needed sums of squares are computed by applying an appropriate 
  regression to the unsubtracted Y values to deal with possible
  imbalances.  Specifically,


    Y' = X'V + E'

  where Y' is the vector of scaled input observations, X' is the factor
  matrix, V is the vector of parameters to be estimated, and E' is a
  residual error term.  This regression is calculated independently
  for each voxel in the input data.  Estimates and sums of squares for
  the elements of V are calculated, and from them F and P scores 
  for the terms of the model above are estimated.  

  For s subjects Y' will be an n by 1 matrix, X' will be n by p, 
  and V will be p by 1, where n=2s and p=s+2.

  The algorithm used assumes that there are two groups and two
  experimental conditions.  The Y' vector is given by:

          /            
          | mean(1,1)  |
          | mean(1,2)  |
    Y'= S | mean(2,1)  |
          | mean(2,2)  |
          | mean(3,1)  |
          | mean(3,1)  |
          |  etc.      |
                      /

  where mean(i,c) is the mean for subject i in condition c, and the
  scaling matrix S is the diagonal matrix with elements:

    S   = sqrt( N(k/2, k%2) )
     k,k

  in which N(i,c) is the number of observations of subject i in 
  condition c and stdv(i,c) is the corresponding standard deviation.

  The factor matrix X'=SX, where S is as above and X has the following
  columns:

   -The first column is all 1's and serves to de-mean the Y vector.  

   -The second column is 1 for rows in condition 2 and -1 for rows
    in condition 1.  This column implements term C in the unsubtracted
    model.

   -The third column is 1 for rows in group 2 and -1 for rows
    in group 1.  This term implements term B in the model.

   -The fourth column is the product of columns 2 and 3 and implements
    the (BC) cross term.

   - s-2 columns follow which reflect the (ABC) difference term in the
    subtracted Y equation.  Each column is 1 for the corresponding
    subject, 0 otherwise, de-meaned within group and condition,
    multiplied by factor 2.  One column is dropped from each group
    for orthogonality.  (Specifically, the column corresponding to
    the last subject in the group is dropped).  

  As an example of one of the subject columns, consider the specific
  case of 20 subjects with 10 in each group.  There would be 9 subject
  columns for each group.  The first subject column in the first group
  would have the row values:

    (-0.9, 0.9, 0.1, -0.1, 0.1, -0.1, ..., 0, 0, 0, 0, ...)

  where there are a total of 9 (0.1, -0.1) pairs and 10 (0,0) pairs.
  These pairs correspond to all subjects other than the first in group
  1 and all 10 subjects in group 2 respectively.

  Note that these are the factor values before scaling by S.
  Multiple regression is performed on these factors, and the estimate
  and variance for factors 1 through 3 are computed.  

  The subject factors as described are orthogonal to the first four
  factors, but missing subject data can break this orthogonality.  To
  avoid this, the regression is actually calculated in two stages.  
  An initial regression is performed on the Y values using the first
  four factors, and a second regression is performed on the residuals
  using the subject factors.

  The mean squared errors of the various columns in this regression
  correspond to mean squared terms needed in test statistics for the 
  subtracted model.  Specifically, the mean square associated with
  factor 4 above corresponds to MSab in the subtracted mixed effects
  model, and the total mean square associated with the last (s-2)
  columns correspond to the MSE of the subtracted mixed effects model.
  (The MSE of the regression is made up of terms which are symmetric
  in the experimental condition and hence do not contribute to the
  subtracted model).  The mean square associated with factor 2 can be
  used with the subtracted MSE to construct a test statistic for the
  experimental condition.
  

    Original Model       Subtracted Model   DOF

      factor 2 MS             MSm            1
      factor 4 MS             MSab           1
      factors &gt;=5 MS          MSE           s-2

  P scores are calculated from the F test statistics using the
  associated degrees of freedom.

  A dataset named mean is returned containing the estimates for the
  first (constant) factor.

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>

  If subjects 1137, 1139, and 1143 are patients and subjects 2213,
  2215, and 2219 are controls, and if the map file "subjmap" provides
  a mapping between subject numbers and the mean, standard deviation,
  and counts files for those subjects in Taliarach space, the command:

    groupcompare.csh -m subjmap 1137 1139 1143 2213 2215 2219

  will produce a between-groups comparison for these subjects.  The
  subjects may appear in any order. The outputs of the script will be 
  the following Pittsburgh MRI datasets: 

    effect_f and effect_p - F and P scores for the average difference
                            over all subjects between the two conditions
      cross_f and cross_p - F and P scores for the difference in the
                            response of the two groups to the two
                            conditions 
                     mean - overall mean
              totalcounts - total samples across all subjects

</pre>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<pre>

  groupcompare.csh keeps scratch files in a temporary directory.  If
  the environment variable F_TEMP is defined this directory will be
  ${F_TEMP}/groupcompare_tmp_NN (where NN is the current process ID);
  otherwise ./groupcompare_tmp_NN will be used.  The temporary
  directory is deleted when groupcompare.csh is finished with it.

  Name map information (used in finding the locations of subjects'
  data) will be read from the files in the environment variable
  F_MAP_PATH if it is defined.  F_MAP_PATH is a colon-separated list
  of file names.  Names appearing in files earlier in F_MAP_PATH
  override those which appear later; files or definitions given on the
  command line with -m or -d switches override any given in
  F_MAP_PATH.
