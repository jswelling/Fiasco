<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  smooth_missing scans a scalar dataset in time series order
  (dimensions txyz or vtxyz for v of extent 1), linearly interpolating
  over "missing" regions.  The "images" chunk in the input data
  is updated according to the contents of the "missing" chunk.
  Output data is of type float.

  smooth_missing -input infile -headerout outheader -dataout outdata

    -input or -i specifies the name of the input mri file (default
     "input.mri").
    -headerout or -h specifies the name of the output header 
     (default "smooth_missing.mri")
    -dataout or -d specifies the name of the output data file
     (default ".dat")

</pre>
<h2>Calculation</h2>
<pre>

  Each time series of the input data is scanned for elements
  which have been marked missing.  When runs of one or more
  missing elements are found, they are patched as follows.
  If valid data is known at both ends of the run, the values
  within the run are set by linear interpolation between the
  valid values.  If the run comes at the beginning or end of
  the time series, the values in the run are set to equal 
  that of the closest known value.  If all the values in the
  time series are missing, they are all set to 0.0 .
