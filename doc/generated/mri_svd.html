    <h1>mri_svd_help</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  mri_svd calculates the eigenvalues and optionally eigenvectors of
  real symmetric matrices stored in Pgh MRI datasets.

  The command line for mri_svd is:
    mri_svd [-chunk Chunkname] [-verbose] [-debug] [-complex]
            [-dimensions AB] [-umatrix UName] [-vmatrix VName] [-wvector] 
            Input

  or
    mri_svd -help [topic]

</pre>
<h2>Defaults</h2>
<pre>

  chunk: images
  dimensions: for 2 of the input file (excluding "v" if complex)

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>Infile</h3>
<pre>

  Infile is the input dataset.  It must have at least two dimensions,
  and if the -dims flag is given those two dimensions must appear
  contiguously and in order in its dimension string.  If the -complex
  flag is given there must be a dimension v in addition to those two
  dimensions, and the v dimension must be first and have an extent of
  two.  Singular value decomposition is performed on those two
  dimensions.

</pre>
<h3>chunkname</h3>
<pre>
 -chunk Chunkname		(-chu|c Chunkname)

 Specifies the chunk that is to be operated on.
     Default value is "images".

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>
  [-verbose]			(-ver|v)

  Requests verbose operation.

</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>
  [-debug]			(-deb)

  Requests debugging output.

</pre>
<h3>complex</h3>
<pre>
  [-complex]                    (-cpx)

  Specifies that the input file is to be treated as complex.  If
  this flag is not given, the 'v' dimension is treated like any
  other dimension.

</pre>
<h3>dimensions</h3>
<pre>
  [-dimensions ab]              (-dim|-d ab)

  Specifies the dimensions over which to solve.  The dimensions ab
  must be a substring of the input data dimensions, and must not
  include the 'v' dimension if the -complex flag is given.  Exactly
  two dimensions must be given.  The default is the first two
  dimensions of the input data (excluding the 'v' dimension if
  -complex is specified).

</pre>
<h3>umatrix</h3>
<pre>
  [-umatrix U]                  (-umt U)

  The U matrix resulting from the singular value decompositions.  If
  this argument is not specified, no U matrix is produced.  At least
  one of -umatrix, -vmatrix, and -wvector must be specified.

</pre>
<h3>vmatrix</h3>
<pre>
  [-vmatrix V]                  (-vmt V)

  The V-transpose matrix resulting from the singular value
  decompositions.  Note that this is the transpose of V.  If
  this argument is not specified, no V matrix is produced.  At least
  one of -umatrix, -vmatrix, and -wvector must be specified.

</pre>
<h3>wvector</h3>
<pre>
  [-wvector W]                  (-wvc W)

  The W vector containing the singular values of the input.
  If this argument is not specified, no W vector is produced.  At 
  least one of -umatrix, -vmatrix, and -wvector must be specified.

</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Details</h3>
<pre>

  This program is basically just a wrapper for the LAPACK routines
  <a href="http://gams.nist.gov/serve.cgi/Module/LAPACK/DGESVD/9350/">DGESVD</a> and <a
  href="http://gams.nist.gov/serve.cgi/Module/LAPACK/ZGESVD/9352/">ZGESVD</a>.
  All the math is carried out in double precision, with
  conversion to and from double precision taking place on input and 
  output as needed.

  Output files are stored as double precision floats if the input was
  double precision floats, and as single precision floats otherwise.

</pre>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>

  Suppose the 'images' chunk of the infile 'input' has dimensions 
  qxt with extents 3:5:10.  The command:

    mri_svd -umatrix u -vmatrix vt -wvector w input

  will produe 3 output files:

    u,  with dimensions qxt, extents 3:3:10
    vt, with dimensions qxt, extents 5:5:10
    w,  with dimensions xt,  extents 3:10

  The x extent of w is the smaller of the extents of q and x in the
  original input, since that is the number of singular values.  Each
  of the 10 sets of 3 values in w holds the singular values of one
  of the 10 3x5 matrices in the original input dataset.

  Each of the 10 3x3 matrices in u, and each of the 10 5x5 matrices in
  vt, hold the orthonormal matrices from one of the 10 3x5 matrices in
  the input.  For example, to see that the matrices of u are
  orthonormal, construct the transpose and multiply:

    mri_permute -order xqt u ut
    mri_remap -order xwt -len 3:3:10 ut
    mri_matmult -out uut u ut
    mri_rpn_math '$q,$w,$t,$1,1,if_print_4' uut
