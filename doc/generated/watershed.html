<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  watershed applies a watershed algorithm to its input, over the
  entire 3D volume or within an optional mask.  Note that this is an
  inverted watershed, flooding downward from peaks rather than upward
  from minima.

  The command line for watershed is:

    watershed [-v] [-debug] [-mask MaskFile] [-algorithm algstring] 
         InFile OutFile

  or 

    watershed -help [topic]

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>

  [-verbose]                    (-v)

  Requests verbose output.

</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>

  [-debug]

  Requests debugging output.

</pre>
<h3>algorithm</h3>
<pre>

  [-algorithm algstring]         (-alg algstring)

  The elements of the algorithm string constrol the details of the
  watershed algorithm; the string is a comma-separated list of those
  elements.  Supported elements are:

    "markboundaries" specifies that boundaries between watershed
                regions should be marked with the special value -1.
    "nomarkboundaries" is the opposite of "markboundaries".
    "fatboundaries" only effects runs for which "markboundaries" is requested.
                If set, voxels for which the highest neighbor is a
                boundary will be considered boundaries themselves.
                In flat regions this can result in wide fields of
                boundary voxels.
    "nofatboundaries" is the opposite of "fatboundaries".  This results in
                boundary regions one voxel wide, but because the
                boundary voxels are of finite extent they still
                effect the future course of the algorithm.  Thus
                under this algorithm non-boundary regions may be
                assigned to different watersheds depending on 
                whether or not -boundaries is specified.
    "alwaysflood" causes flat regions around each newly identified voxel
                to be flood filled.  This is technically correct, but
                slower than the "minflood" option.
    "floodmaxima" is the opposite of "alwaysflood".  Under this option 
                only newly-identified maxima are flooded.  Voxels in
                flat regions which are not local maxima have ties
                broken by treating the voxels toward the (0,0,0)
                corner of the array as if they were slightly lower
                than their neighbors.

  The default algorithm is "nomarkboundaries,thinbounds,floodmaxima".

<h3>mask</h3>
<pre>

  [-mask MaskFile]               (-m MaskFile)

  Specifies a mask for the watershed transform.  The mask dataset must
  have dimensions matching those of the input dataset; any voxel for 
  which the mask value is non-zero is considered to be within the
  mask.  The default (no MaskFile provided) is equivalent to supplying
  a mask of all 1's.

</pre>
<h3>InFile</h3>
<pre>

  Specifies the input dataset, which must have dimensions (v)xyz(t).
  If v or t dimensions are present, their extent must be 1.  The
  program operates on the "images" chunk.  This argument is required.

</pre>
<h3>OutFile</h3>
<pre>
  
  Specifies the output dataset.  This argument is required.  The
  dimensions of the output will match those of the input; the output
  data type will be int32.  Voxels outside the mask will have the
  value 0; those inside the mask will be assigned integer values
  increasing from 1 depending on the watershed region with which they
  are associated.  If boundaries are requested, the boundary voxels
  are assigned a value -1.
  
</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  This is approximately algorithm 4.3 from "The Watershed Transform:
  Definitions, Algorithms and Parallelization Strategies", Roerdink
  and Meijster, Fundamenta Informaticae 41 (2001) 187-228, modified
  to use a flood fill in constant regions. The 'images' chunk is
  always used.

  Note that requesting boundaries causes changes to the watershed 
  structure in low-gradient regions, because the boundary voxels
  themselves take up space and distort the 'flow'!</pre>
