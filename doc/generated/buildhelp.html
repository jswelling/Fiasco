<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

   Buildhelp generates C language source code from .help files.

   To run buildhelp, use:
     buildhelp [-d] [-i indent] [-t topic] helpfile progname

   or:
     buildhelp [-help [topic]]

   If no arguments are supplied, a short usage line is provided.  
   Spaces after the -i and -t flags are optional.  Topics are 
   not case-sensitive.  The special helpfile name "-" signifies 
   that the standard input should be read.

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>d</h3>
<pre>
  -d

   A flag that when present tells buildhelp to make the generated
   file, prognameHelp.c, a driver file (i.e., include a main()).

</pre>
<h3>i</h3>
<pre>
   [-i indentNum]

   Ex: -i 2  --&gt; Indent the lines two spaces

   Indents each line of the generated help text by the value of
   indentNum spaces (indent can be values &gt;= 0).  The default value is
   1 which thus includes the leading space on each line of help text.

</pre>
<h3>t</h3>
<pre>
   [-t topic]

   Makes the given value of topic the argument to Help() in the driver.
   Default value is "selecttopic". This is only relevant if -d is
   supplied.  

</pre>
<h3>help</h3>
<pre>
   [-help [topic]]

   Engage this help system.  With no further arguments, 
   interactive help is supplied; if a topic is supplied, help 
   for that topic is given.  If the topic argument is supplied 
   as a string "topic1 topic2 ..." in quotes, then each topic 
   in the list is documented.

</pre>
<h2>Output</h2>
<pre>

 buildhelp generates an ANSI C file xxxHelp.c, where the progname
 argument is substituted for xxx.  The source code in xxxHelp.c makes
 reference to the include file "helphelp.h" and the library file
 "libcrg.a" but is otherwise self-contained.  The code and makefile
 necessary to create these latter files are included with the standard
 distribution.

</pre>
<h2>File-Format</h2>
<pre>

 The help file consists of a sequence of topic names followed by their
 associated help text.

 Topic names are defined on their own line by putting a * in the first
 column.  Each topic name is a text string containing no whitespace,
 although whitespace may surround the name on both sides.  Topic names
 must be unique, but they can have common substrings.

 Names of the form topic:subtopic represent topic-subtopic pairs.
 They are written in a different format on output;  for example in
 interactive mode all subtopics of a given topic appear together.
 Subtopics are accessed by subtopic name, so the associated topic
 serves only for grouping purposes.  Hence all subtopic names must
 be unique, even between separate topics.  It is also an error
 to refer to a topic name both with and without subtopics.

 The help text consists of every character following the topic name,
 except for the space in the first column, until the next topic is
 defined or end-of-file occurs.  The -i flag to buildhelp allows the
 user to control indentation of the help text.

 All text above the first topic definition is ignored.

</pre>
<h2>Compilations</h2>
<pre>

 The help information can be incorporated into compilation by
 including the file xxxHelp.o as a dependency in the Makefile target
 line and in the final compilation line.  (Here, xxx should be
 replaced by the value of the progname argument.)  Then, in the
 makefile the following target should be added

 xxxHelp.o: helpfilename
 	buildhelp [options] helpfilename progname
 	$(CC) -c xxxHelp.c
 	rm xxxHelp.c

 Note that because of the library structure of the efunc routines, if
 no xxxHelp.o is supplied, the program will still run, although the
 help system will not engage.

</pre>
<h2>Topic-Completions</h2>
<pre>

 In the case there is ambiguity, the help system will provide a list
 of possible completions; however, an exact match always takes
 precedence.  Topic-subtopic pairs are matched only on the subtopic
 name.
