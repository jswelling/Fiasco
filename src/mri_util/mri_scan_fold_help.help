*Introduction

  mri_scan_fold reorders the slices of a Pgh MRI dataset from the
  order in which they are acquired to their proper spatial order
  (z values), or vice versa.  Various reordering patterns are
  supported, to appropriately cope with the scan acquisition patterns
  of various scanners.
 
  To run mri_scan_fold use:

    mri_scan_fold [-zdm nslices] [-verbose] [-debug] [-reorder PatternName] 
         [-direction ZeroOrOne] [-force] infile outfile

  or:

    mri_scan_fold -help


*Defaults

  Defaults depend on reordering information in the input file; see below

*Arguments:zdm

  [-zdm nslices]

     If a chunk of the input file contains the dimension t but not
     the adjacent dimensions zt, this option specifies the number of
     slices into which the chunk will be folded.  The option has no
     effect on other chunks, and exists primarily for backward 
     compatibility.  The chunk's t extent modulo nslices must be zero.
    
*Arguments:reorder

  [-reorder Pattern]  (-reo Pattern)

    This option specifies the reordering pattern.  The default is to
    use the pattern specified in the chunk's 'reorder_pattern' tag.
    If the chunk has no such tag, but the "images" or "samples" chunk
    does (checked in that order), that pattern becomes the default
    pattern.  If after checking the chunk itself and both the
    "images" and "samples" chunks there is still no default pattern,
    'even/odd' becomes the default.  This is the pattern used for
    functional scans on GE scanners.  If a pattern is specified on 
    the command line or the "images" or "samples" chunk but it
    disagrees with that of the 'reorder_pattern' tag of the chunk
    being folded, mri_scan_fold aborts unless the -force flag is set, 
    in which case the specified pattern is applied.

    For backward compatibility, the following special values of
    Pattern are supported:
     -reo TRUE or 1 implies pattern 'even/odd'
     -reo FALSE or 0  implies pattern 'none'

*Arguments:direction

 [-direction 0|1]    (-dir 0|1)

   This option specifies the reordering direction, where '1' specifies
   reordering from acquisition order to spatial order and '0'
   specifies the opposite.  The default is to use the direction
   specified in the chunk's 'reorder' tag.  If the chunk has no such
   tag, but the "images" or "samples" chunk does (checked in that
   order), that direction becomes the default.  If after checking the
   chunk itself and both the "images" and "samples" chunks there is
   still no default direction, '1' becomes the default.  This
   correponds to the usual direction of processing, where data from
   the scanner is put in spatial order for analysis.  If a direction
   is specified on the command line or the "images" or "samples" chunk
   but it disagrees with that of the 'reorder' tag of the chunk being
   folded, mri_scan_fold aborts unless the -force flag is set, in
   which case the specified pattern is applied.

*Arguments:force

 [-force]

  Causes chunks to be reordered according to the pattern and direction
  on the command line or in the "images" or "samples" chunks
  regardless of the chunk's own "reorder_pattern" and "reorder" tags.


*Arguments:verbose

 [-verbose]		(-ver|v)

  Displays the progress of mri_scan_fold.

*Arguments:debug

 [-debug]		(-dbg)

  Displays debugging information.

*Arguments:infile 

  Specifies the input file name.  This parameter is required.  All
  chunks within the file which have dimensions ...zt..., or ...t... 
  with an appropriate extent if the -zdm argument is given, will be
  folded.  Other chunks are copied to the output just as they are.

     
*Argumenets:outfile 

  Specifies the output file name.  This parameter is required.

*Details

  Scanners often acquire slices in an order other than their spatial
  order.  Sometimes the images will automatically be reordered by
  smartreader, but even in those cases information about the
  acquisition order must be retained to properly match slices to the
  times when they were acquired.  Fiasco stores this information in
  the Pgh MRI tags '<chunk>.reorder' and '<chunk>.reorder_pattern',
  where <chunk> is typically 'images' or 'samples'.  '<chunk>.reorder
  is 1 if the slices are in acquisition order and 0 if the slices are
  in spatial order.  <chunk>.reorder_pattern is a string specifying
  the reordering pattern.  For example, GE scanners typically use the
  'even/odd' pattern; Siemens scanners typically use
  'reversed_odd/even'.  The full list of strings recognized by
  mri_scan_fold is given in the section on 
  \<a  href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fiasco/index.php?ref=overview/pff_keymeanings4.shtml"\>Customary  Meanings of Keys\<a\> of the Pgh MRI documentation on the 
  \<a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fiasco"\>Fiasco Home Page\<a\>.

  mri_scan_fold first attempts to establish an 'expected' reordering
  direction and pattern, by the following algorithm.  If a direction
  or pattern is specified on the command line, it becomes the expected
  pattern or direction.  Failing that, the chunks "images" and
  "samples" in that order are checked for '<chunk>.reorder' and
  '<chunk>.reorder_pattern' tags, and any tag found becomes the
  expected direction or pattern.

  The program than proceeds chunk by chunk through the input file,
  checking to see if the given chunk should be folded.  It will be
  folded if its dimension string includes the substring 'zt', or if
  the -zdm command line option is given, the chunk dimension string
  includes 't', and the extent of t is a multiple of the value of
  zdm.  (This last is for backward compatibility).  If a chunk is not
  to be folded it is copied to the output unchanged.

  If a chunk is to be folded, it is checked for <chunk>.reorder and 
  <chunk>.reorder_pattern tags.  If they are found but either differs
  from the 'expected' values, the program aborts unless the -force
  flag is set.  If the chunk has no such tags or they are in agreement
  with the 'expected' values, the 'expected' values are used.  If
  there are no 'expected' values, the chunk's values are used, or
  failing that, default values of 'even/odd' for the pattern and '1'
  for the direction are used.  The chunk is appropriately folded, and
  the <chunk>.reorder and <chunk>.reorder_pattern tags are set in the
  output chunk.  Note that if the reordering direction was 1, the
  <chunk>.reorder tag will be set to 0, and vice versa.  Thus repeated
  applications of mri_scan_fold will repeatedly shuffle and un-shuffle
  the slices.

*Examples

  mri_scan_fold input output

  This will reorder the data of 'input' according to it's reordering
  tags.  Note that if the data has already been folded to spatial
  order, this will unfold it again!  

  mri_scan_fold -zdm 15 -reo 'reversed_odd/even' -dir 1 may pole

  If may has a t dimension of 630=15*42 images and no z dimension,
  this will produce 15 slices in the z dimension of "may" and put them
  in "pole".  The z and t dimensions of "pole" will be 15 and 42.  The
  'reversed_odd/even' reordering pattern will be used, and "may" will
  be assumed to have its data in acquisition order.
