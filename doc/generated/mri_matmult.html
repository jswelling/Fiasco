<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  mri_matmult does matrix multiplication on Pgh MRI datasets.

  To run mri_matmult use:
    mri_matmult -out Outfile [-chunk Chunk-Name] [-v] [-debug] 
 	[-complex] File1 File2

  or:
    mri_matmult -help

</pre>
<h2>Default</h2>
<pre>

  Chunk_name: images


</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>chunk</h3>
<pre>

  -chunk Chunk-Name      (-chu|c Chunk-Name)

  Selects the chunk to be multiplied.  This chunk must exist in both
  File1 and File2, and the chunks in those two files must be of the
  correct "shape" to be multiplied (see Details).  Default is the
  chunk "images".

</pre>
<h3>File1</h3>
<pre>

  File1

  File1 is the first (left) input dataset.  This argument is required,
  and this dataset must contain the selected chunk.  In the complex
  case (see -complex below) the input file must have first dimension v
  with extent 2.

  See the Details or Examples sections for dimension order
  requirements for this input file.

</pre>
<h3>File2</h3>
<pre>

  File2

  File2 is the second (right) input dataset.  This argument is required,
  and this dataset must contain the selected chunk.  In the complex
  case (see -complex below) the first dimension must be v with extent 2.

  See the Details or Examples sections for dimension order
  requirements for this input file.

</pre>
<h3>Outfile</h3>
<pre>

  -out Outfile

  Outfile will contain the output dataset.  The selected chunk of this
  dataset will be the product of the corresponding chunks of File1
  and File2, with summation being done over their common dimension.
  Other chunks and tags will be identical to those of File1.  This
  argument is required.  The output datatype is float unless the first
  input is double precision, in which case the output is double
  precision as well.

</pre>
<h3>complex</h3>
<pre>

  [-complex]				(-cpx)

  Turns on complex arithmetic.  The input and output files must all
  have a leading dimension v with extent 2, and the multiplication
  and sum are performed as if v=0 and v=1 were the real and imaginary
  parts of a complex number.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>

  [-verbose]				(-ver|v)

  Turns on verbose output.

</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>

  [-debug]				(-dbg)

  Turns on debugging output.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  Let the selected chunk of File1 be called _L_ (for left), and
  let the selected chunk of File2 be called _R_ .  _L_ and _R_
  are matrices, each with dimensions in a specific order and of
  specific extents.  To be multiplied, _L_ and _R_ must have
  dimension orders of the forms XQYS and QZS respectively.  (This
  is for the scalar case; we'll return to the complex case
  momentarily).  X, Y, Z, and S are character strings with no common
  characters; Q is any single character not in X, Y, Z, or S.  The
  extents of the dimensions in S and Q must be the same in _L_ and _R_.

  If the chunks match this pattern, they can be multiplied.  The
  result will be a matrix _P_ with the dimension string XZYS with
  values calculated as follows:

    for each s in S {
      for each x in X {
        for each y in Y {
          for each z in Z {
            total= 0
            for each q in Q {
              total= total+ _L_[xqys] * _R_[qzs]
            }
            _P_[xzys]= total
          }
        }
      }
    }
            
  In other words, there is a separate matrix multiplaction over q for
  every s in S.

  For example, suppose the dimensions of  the selected chunk in File1 
  are abxytw and those in File2 are xztw.  Then X corresponds to ab, 
  Q to x, Y to y, Z to z, and S to tw.  These two chunks can be
  multiplied to produce a chunk with dimensions abzytw.  However, if 
  the dimensions of File2 were xzwt there would be no consistent 
  pattern for S and the chunks could not be multiplied.

  In the complex case, the first dimensions of both _L_ and _R_
  must be v, and that dimension must have an extent of 2.  This
  dimension is interpreted as the real and imaginary part of a chunk
  of complex numbers.

  All of the math is carried out in double precision, with conversion to
  and from double precision taking place on input and output as needed.

  I know there is no inherent reason why the summed-over dimension
  must be leftmost in File2; it just makes my life easier.  Use
  mri_permute if necessary.

<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>

  Suppose the dataset file1 has the following images chunk:

    images.datatype = float32
    images.dimensions = xqt
    images.extent.t = 10
    images.extent.q = 2
    images.extent.x = 5

  and that the dataset file2 has the following images chunk:

    images.dimensions = qyz
    images.extent.q = 2
    images.extent.y = 5
    images.extent.z = 10

  These two datasets share the common dimension q, which has extent 2.
  q is the leftmost dimension of file2, as mri_matmult rather
  capriciously requires.  The output dataset will thus have 
  dimensions xyzt, with the following extents:

    images.dimensions = xyzt
    images.extent.t = 10
    images.extent.x = 5
    images.extent.y = 5
    images.extent.z = 10

  It would be an error to try to multiply these datasets with the
  -complex flag set, because they lack the appropriate leading
  dimension v.  

  Suppose that dataset file1 contains complex data as follows:

    images.datatype = float32
    images.dimensions = vxqt
    images.extent.v = 2
    images.extent.t = 10
    images.extent.q = 2
    images.extent.x = 5

  and that dataset file2 contains complex data as follows:

    images.dimensions = vqyz
    images.extent.v = 2
    images.extent.q = 2
    images.extent.y = 5
    images.extent.z = 10

  It would be an error to multiply these datasets without the -complex
  flag set, since they share two common dimensions (v and q).  With
  the -complex flag set, the output dataset will have the following
  dimensions and extents:

    images.dimensions = vxyzt
    images.extent.v = 2
    images.extent.t = 10
    images.extent.x = 5
    images.extent.y = 5
    images.extent.z = 10

  Suppose that dataset file1 contains complex data as follows:

    images.datatype = float32
    images.dimensions = vxqtsc
    images.extent.c = 4
    images.extent.s = 7
    images.extent.v = 2
    images.extent.t = 10
    images.extent.q = 2
    images.extent.x = 5


  and that dataset file2 contains complex data as follows:

    images.dimensions = vqyzsc
    images.extent.c = 4
    images.extent.s = 7
    images.extent.v = 2
    images.extent.q = 2
    images.extent.y = 5
    images.extent.z = 10

  It would be an error to multiply these datasets without the -complex
  flag set.  With the -complex flag set, the output dataset will have 
  the following dimensions and extents:

    images.dimensions = vxyztsc
    images.extent.c = 4
    images.extent.s = 7
    images.extent.v = 2
    images.extent.t = 10
    images.extent.x = 5
    images.extent.y = 5
    images.extent.z = 10
