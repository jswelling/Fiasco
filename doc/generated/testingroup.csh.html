<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  testingroup.csh takes mean, standard deviation, and count data for
  multiple subjects in one group in each of two conditions, and
  produces F and P scores for the response to the conditions based
  on a random effects model.  An overall mean is also produced for
  convenience in doing overlays, and a data set of total samples per 
  voxel is produced as a check that the regions of interest have been 
  well sampled.

  testingroup.csh [-m namemap] [-d key=value] subj1 subj2 ...

    -m namemap uses the specified mapfile (along with defaults in
       F_MAP_PATH) to find subject directories.  Multiple -m
       options may be used.
    -d key=value defines the given additional key-value pair

  or

  testingroup.csh -help [topic]

  All of the subjects must have been transformed into the same
  coordinates, presumably Taliarach space.

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  The statistical model used by testingroup.csh is:

    Y   = M + A  + B  + (AB)
     ijk       i    j       ij

  where M is the overall mean, 0&lt;i&lt;s identifies the s subjects and 
  0&lt;j&lt;2 represents the 2 conditions.  These terms cover all of the 
  degrees of freedom of the 2*s observations of Y.  This will be 
  a mixed model, with subject being a random effect and group being 
  fixed.  For this model, the relevant test statistics are:

      Factor       Test

        A        MSA/MSE   (random)

        B        MSB/MSAB  (fixed)

       (AB)      MSAB/MSE  (random)

  (see "Applied Liner Statistical Models" by Neter et al, chapter 24).

  The needed sums of squares are computed by applying an appropriate 
  regression to the Y values.  Specifically,

    Y' = X'V + E'

  where Y' is the vector of scaled input observations, X' is the factor
  matrix, V is the vector of parameters to be estimated, and E' is a
  residual error term.  This regression is calculated independently
  for each voxel in the input data.  Estimates and sums of squares for
  the elements of V are calculated, and from them F and P scores 
  for the terms of the model above are estimated.  

  For s subjects Y' will be an n by 1 matrix, X' will be n by p, 
  and V will be p by 1, where n=2s and p=s+3.

  The algorithm used assumes that there are two groups and two
  experimental conditions.  The Y' vector is given by:

          /            
          | mean(1,1)  |
          | mean(1,2)  |
    Y'= S | mean(2,1)  |
          | mean(2,2)  |
          | mean(3,1)  |
          | mean(3,1)  |
          |  etc.      |
                      /

  where mean(i,c) is the mean for subject i in condition c, and the
  scaling matrix S is the diagonal matrix with elements:

    S   = sqrt( N(k/2, k%2) )
     k,k

  in which N(i,c) is the number of observations of subject i in 
  condition c.

  The factor matrix X'=SX, where S is as above and X has the following
  columns:

   -The first column is all 1's and serves to de-mean the Y vector.  

   -The second column is 1 for rows in condition 2 and -1 for rows
    in condition 1.  This column implements term C in the unsubtracted
    model.

   - s-1 columns follow which reflect the (AB) difference term in the
    subtracted Y equation.  Each column is 1 for the corresponding
    subject, 0 otherwise, de-meaned within condition, multiplied by 
    factor 2.  One column is dropped for orthogonality. (Specifically, 
    the column corresponding to the last subject is dropped).  

  As an example of one of the subject columns, consider the specific
  case of 10 subjects.  There would be 9 subject columns, the first 
  of which would have the row values:

    (-0.9, 0.9, 0.1, -0.1, 0.1, -0.1, ...)

  where there are a total of 9 (0.1, -0.1) pairs. These pairs
  correspond to all subjects other than the first.

  Note that these are the factor values before scaling by S.
  Multiple regression is performed on these factors, and the estimate
  and variance for factors 1 through 3 are computed.  

  The subject factors as described are orthogonal to the first two
  factors, but missing subject data can break this orthogonality.  To
  avoid this, the regression is actually calculated in two stages.  
  An initial regression is performed on the Y values using the first
  two factors, and a second regression is performed on the residuals
  using the subject factors.

  The mean squared errors of the various columns in this regression
  correspond to mean squared terms needed in test statistics for the 
  subtracted model.  Specifically, the mean square associated with
  factor 2 above corresponds to MSB in the mixed effects model, and 
  the total mean square associated with the last (s-1) columns 
  correspond to the MSAB of the mixed effects model.

    Regression term       Mean Square       DOF

      factor 2              MSB              1
     factors &gt;=3            MSAB             s-1

  An F statistic for the effect of the experimental conditions is 
  constructed from MSB/MSAB.  P scores are calculated from this F
  statistic using the appropriate cumulative distribution function.

  A dataset named mean is returned containing the estimates for the
  first (constant) factor.

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>

  If subjects 1137, 1139, and 1143 are patients, and if the map file
  "subjmap" provides a mapping between subject numbers and the mean,
  standard deviation, and counts files for those subjects in Taliarach
  space, the command:

    testingroup.csh -m subjmap 1137 1139 1143

  will produce an in-group test for these subjects.  The subjects may
  appear in any order. The outputs of the script will be the following
  Pittsburgh MRI datasets:

    effect_f and effect_p - F and P scores for the average difference
                            over all subjects between the two conditions
                     mean - overall mean
              totalcounts - total samples across all subjects

</pre>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<pre>

  testingroup.csh keeps scratch files in a temporary directory.  If
  the environment variable F_TEMP is defined this directory will be
  ${F_TEMP}/testingroup_tmp_NN (where NN is the current process ID);
  otherwise ./testingroup_tmp_NN will be used.  The temporary
  directory is deleted when testingroup.csh is finished with it.

  Name map information (used in finding the locations of subjects'
  data) will be read from the files in the environment variable
  F_MAP_PATH if it is defined.  F_MAP_PATH is a colon-separated list
  of file names.  Names appearing in files earlier in F_MAP_PATH
  override those which appear later; files or definitions given on the
  command line with -m or -d switches override any given in
  F_MAP_PATH.
