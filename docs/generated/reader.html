  reader.m -help [topic]

  Command Line Options (see Arguments:flag)

  -help   Engage help system, providing help on topic, if supplied,
          or starting the interactive help system otherwise.

  Note: Old-data-file and New-data-file must differ.

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>

  -input Old-data-file        (-i Old-data-file)

     Specifies that data should be read from Old-data-file.
     Default value is "input.dat".  If -readheader is specified,
     the input file is treated as either a Pfile or a Windaq file
     and header information is read from it.

     Note: If Old-data-file and New-data-file have identical names
           an error results and the program exits.

</pre>
<h3>dataout</h3>
<pre>

  -dataout New-data-file      (-da New-data-file)

     Specifies that output data should be written to New-data-file.
     Default value is ".dat".

     Note: If Old-data-file and New-data-file have identical names
           an error results and the program exits.

</pre>
<h3>dims</h3>
<pre>

  -dims X-Dim Y-Dim Z-Dim T-Dim    (-di X-Dim Y-Dim Z-Dim T-Dim)

     Specifies length (extent) of each dimension of the data.
     The order of the dimensions is currently assumed to be
     "xyzt", and thus the dimension lengths are read in this
     order.  All four lengths should be specified (space delimited).
     Default value is 1 1 1 1.

     Note: If -readheader is specified, header information supplies
           this data, so this option is incompatible with -readheader.

</pre>
<h3>headerout</h3>
<pre>

  -headerout Header-file      (-h Header-file)

     Specifies that output header should be written to Header-file.
     Default value is "output.mri".

</pre>
<h3>offset</h3>
<pre>

  -offset N-bytes             (-o N-bytes)

     Specifies the number of bytes to be ignored at the beginning
     of Old-data-file.
     Default is 0.

     Note: If -readheader is specified, header information supplies
           this data, so this option is incompatible with -readheader.

</pre>
<h3>reorder</h3>
<pre>

  -reorder Boolean            (-r Boolean)

     If Boolean is true, the images will be re-ordered according
     to the standard EPI data collection scheme, in order to
     store images adjacent to those which lie adjacent in space
     (as opposed to adjacent in collection time).  The 
     re-ordering assumes that the images comes in the order:
       0 2 4 6 ... (Z-Dim - 1) 1 3 5 ... (Z-Dim - 2)  if Z-Dim is odd
       0 2 4 6 ... (Z-Dim - 2) 1 3 5 ... (Z-Dim - 1)  if Z-Dim is even
     where 0 1 2 ... Z-Dim is the desired order.
     Default value is false.

     Note: -reorder true works only with -dataorder vxyzt (the
           default).  -reorder true is incompatible with -dataorder 
           vxytz.

     Note: If -readheader is specified, header information supplies
           this data, so this option is incompatible with -readheader.

</pre>
<h3>skip</h3>
<pre>

  -skip N-bytes               (-s N-bytes)

     Specifies the number of bytes to skip (in Old-Data-file) between
     data blocks.  If dataorder is vxyzt (the default), this number
     of bytes is skipped between each image read (i.e. each read of 
     X-Dim * Y-Dim values * Z-Dim values).  If dataorder is vxytz,
     this number of bytes is skipped after each group of T-Dim images.

     Note: If -readheader is specified, header information supplies
           this data, so this option is incompatible with -readheader.

</pre>
<h3>sliceskip</h3>
<pre>

  -sliceskip N-bytes               (-ss N-bytes)

     Specifies the number of bytes to skip (in Old-Data-file)
     between each slice read (i.e. each read of X-Dim * Y-Dim values).

     Note: If -readheader is specified, header information supplies
           this data, so this option is incompatible with -readheader.

</pre>
<h3>type</h3>
<pre>

  -type Data-type             (-t Data-type)

     Specifies the binary storage type of the data in Old-data-file.
     The possible values of Data-type are:
        "uchar"  (or "u" or "MRI_UINT8")           :  unsigned char
        "short"  (or "s" or "MRI_INT16")           :  short int
        "long"   (or "l" or "MRI_INT32" or "int")  :  long int
        "float"  (or "f" or "MRI_FLOAT32")         :  float
        "double" (or "d" or "MRI_FLOAT64")         :  double
     Default value is "short".  

     Note: The datatype of the output Pgh MRI dataset may not match
           this datatype, because of filtering computations which
           may be performed.

     Note: If -readheader is specified, header information supplies
           this data, so this option is incompatible with -readheader.

</pre>
<h3>veclen</h3>
<pre>

  -veclen Vector-length       (-v Vector-length)

     Specifies the dimensionality of the data value at each pixel
     location.  For example, complex numbers havevector-length 2.  
     This is the fastest varying dimension.
     Default value is 2.

     Note: If -readheader is specified, header information supplies
           this data, so this option is incompatible with -readheader.

</pre>
<h3>dataorder</h3>
<pre>

  -dataorder vxyzt|vxytz      (-do vxyzt|vxytz)

     Specifies the data order in both input and output files.
     Valid strings are "vxyzt" for a time series of complete image
     volumes, vs. vxytz for a collection of series, each representing
     a single slice for all times.  
     Default is vxyzt.  

     Note: If -readheader is specified, header information supplies
           this data, so this option is incompatible with -readheader.

     Note: -reorder true works only with -dataorder vxyzt (the
           default).  -reorder true is incompatible with -dataorder 
           vxytz.

     Note: If the input file contains multiple shots (as recognized
           by -readheader), the output dataorder will contain an
           "s" dimension representing those shots.  

</pre>
<h3>tag</h3>
<pre>

  -tag idtag

     Specifies that the given string is to be associated with the
     data by including it in the Pittsburgh MRI file produced.  The
     tag will become the value of the key "images.scan.id".  
     This is typically used to attach a unique scan ID to the file. 

</pre>
<h3>readheader</h3>
<pre>

  -readheader

     Specifies that header data is to be read from the input file.
     This implies that the input file is either a GE LX Pfile or a 
     Windaq file.  This flag is incompatible with several flags which 
     provide header information directly.  In some cases this option 
     causes the -ychop option to be set, if reader determines it will
     be needed based on data in the header.

</pre>
<h3>xchop</h3>
<pre>

  -xchop

     Specifies that the zero frequency data in the frequency encoding
     direction comes first in each k space row of input data, rather
     than in the middle of the row.  This switch phase shifts the
     data by pi/2, putting the zero frequency component in mid-row
     in keeping with the Fiasco convention.

     Note: This option is incompatible with a Windaq file and will 
           not be executed if included with one.

</pre>
<h3>ychop</h3>
<pre>

  -ychop

     Specifies that the zero frequency data in the phase encoding
     direction comes first in each k space column of input data, rather
     than in the middle of the column.  This switch phase shifts the
     data by pi/2, putting the zero frequency component in mid-column
     in keeping with the Fiasco convention.  The -readheader option
     sometimes causes -ychop to be set, since GE LX scanner data 
     may require this operation.

     Note: This option is incompatible with a Windaq file and will 
           not be executed if included with one.

</pre>
<h3>autoscale</h3>
<pre>

  -autoscale

     Specifies that the output is to be scaled by a constant factor
     such that the 2D FFT of the first slice has a specified "nice"
     range.  Note that this does not imply that the reconstructed
     images will all have that range.  The range of the first
     reconstructed image may not even have this range, if the input
     data is twoshot or partial k (this is not compensated for
     during scaling).  However, even in these circumstances the
     ranges should be reasonable.

     Note: This option is incompatible with a Windaq file and will 
           not be executed if included with one.

</pre>
<h3>phaseref</h3>
<pre>

  -phaseref Phaseref-file

     Specifies the GE LX2 phase reference file for use with this
     data.  This file typically is named "ref.dat".  There is no
     default; absense of this flag means that phase reference
     correction is not carried out.  This option can only be used
     along with the -readheader option.

     Note: This option is incompatible with a Windaq file and will 
           not be executed if included with one.

</pre>
<h3>bandpass</h3>
<pre>

  -bandpass Bandpass-dir

     Specifies the directory in which GE LX2 bandpass correction
     files are to be found.  There is no default; absense of this
     flag means that bandpass correction is not carried out.
     These files have names like "bcrcvs1.dat", "bcrcvs2.dat", etc.
     This option can only be used along with the -readheader option.

     Note: This option is incompatible with a Windaq file and will 
           not be executed if included with one.

</pre>
<h3>rampfile</h3>
<pre>

  -rampfile Rampsample-file

     Specifies the GE LX2 ramp sampling correction data file for
     use with this data.  This file is typically named "vrgf.dat".  
     There is no default; absence of this flag means that ramp
     sampling correction is not carried out.  This option can
     only be used along with the -readheader option.

     Note: This option is incompatible with a Windaq file and will 
           not be executed if included with one.


</pre>
<h3>bigendian</h3>
<pre>

  -bigendian

     Specifies that the input is in bigendian order.  This is only
     of concern if the input comes from a foreign machine.  The
     default is to expect bigendian input data (since all the MRI
     scanners we know of produce data in that order).

     Note: If -readheader is specified, header information supplies
           this data, so this option is incompatible with -readheader.

</pre>
<h3>littleendian</h3>
<pre>

  -littleendian

     Specifies that the input is in littleendian order.  This is only
     of concern if the input comes from a foreign machine.  The
     default is to expect bigendian input data (since all the MRI
     scanners we know of produce data in that order).

     Note: If -readheader is specified, header information supplies
           this data, so this option is incompatible with -readheader.


</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>

  -debug

     Causes debugging output to be written to stderr.


</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>ByteOrder</h3>
<pre>

  Data files contain the data, stored in binary format.  By default,
  the input is assumed to be in bigendian byte order; this is the
  format produced by scanners (to our knowledge).  Output data is
  written in the native byte order of the machine running "reader".
  Since Pittsburgh MRI format includes information about the byte
  order of its data, the user should not need to be concerned with the
  byte order of "reader"'s output.

  However, if the input data has been produced on a littleendian
  machine (for example by AFNI running on an Intel machine), the user
  must use the -littleendian flag to specify the input byte order.
  Note that this is true even if "reader" and (for example) AFNI are
  running on the same littleendian machine!  Unless told otherwise,
  "reader" *always* assumes that its input data is in bigendian
  order.

</pre>
<h3>DataType</h3>
<pre>

  By default, input data are assumed to be stored as unsigned short
  integers.  This is the format produced by scanners (to our
  knowledge).  The output datatype will also be unsigned short
  integers, unless the details of an input operation force "reader" to 
  convert to floating point.  Since the Pittsburgh MRI format includes 
  information about the stored datatype, it is not usually necessary
  for the user to be concerned with the output data type.  If
  necessary, the utility program "mri_type_convert" can be used to
  convert the output dataset to another format.

  If the input data are not in short integer format, the appropriate
  -type option must be used to give "reader" the needed format
  information.  This can occur if the input data is output for some
  other program.  For example, data converted by AFNI to Talairach
  coordinates is stored as floats.  Thus "-type float" must be used
  when it is read.

</pre>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<pre>

  If -readheader is set, the input data is assumed to be either a 
  Pfile from a GE LX scanner or a Windaq file.

  If it is a Pfile from a GE LX scanner, several correction steps 
  are performed.  These include ramp sampling correction, bandpass 
  asymmetry correction, and phase reference correction if the
  appropriate input files are provided.  Output data is always phase
  shifted by pi/2 in the phase encoding direction to match the 
  standard, which assumes that the zero frequency point is at the
  center of the sampled raster in K space.  Baseline correction must
  be performed before this shift, so it is always done for data read
  from GE LX Pfiles.

  If the input data is a Windaq file, the output file has the following
  dimensions: v is the number of channels; t is the number of samples;
  and x, y, and z are all equal to 1.

  If -readheader is not set, the input data is assumed to be raw and
  to require no filtering.  Baseline correction is not done in this
  case.
