<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  align_by_permutation.py reorders datasets to match a prototype, for
  example converting a saggital scan to have the data order of an
  axial scan.

   align_by_permutation.py [-v][-d] --out outDS inputDS protoDS

   where:
    -v specifies verbose output
    -d specifies debugging output
    outDS is the output dataset to be created
    inputDS is the input dataset.  It must have dimensions (v)xyz(t),
      where the v and t extents are 1 if present.
    protoDS is the prototype for outDS.  For example, if inputDS
      is coronal and protoDS is axial, outDS will be axial.  protoDS
      must have dimensions (v)xyz(t), where the v and t extents are 1 
      if present.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  This program doesn't do alignment in the true sense, in that there
  is no attempt to line up the individual pixels of the input and
  prototype datasets.  Its purpose is to change scan slice
  orientation, for example shuffling the data of a coronal scan so
  that it matches an axial scan.  It makes no difference to this
  routine whether the prototype is axial or oblique axial; only the
  dominant component of the slice normal is considered.

  The data in the input are shuffled around to have the layout 
  appropriate for a scan of the type given by the prototype.  This
  implies a redefinition of what the X, Y, and Z directions are, and
  the corner coordinates (images.tlb and etc.) are modified to reflect
  this.  

  Some reorderings require rows of data to be reversed, so that (for 
  example) the voxels of the nose move from earlier in the file than
  those of the back of the head to later in the file.  When needed,
  this is accomplished by doing two successive forward Fourier 
  transforms.  A side effect of this procedure is that the data is
  converted to floating point, and the data values are changed by
  small amounts (on the order of rounding error).  Thus when row
  reversals are necessary the output data is not precisely a
  reshuffled version of the input, but it is very close.
