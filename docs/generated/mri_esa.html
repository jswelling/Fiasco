    <h1>mri_esa_help</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  mri_esa calculates the eigenvalues and optionally eigenvectors of
  real symmetric matrices stored in Pgh MRI datasets.

  The command line for mri_esa is:
    mri_esa [-chunk Chunkname] [-verbose] [-debug] [-number nEigen] 
     [-upper] [-eigenvectors EvecFile] [-descend] 
            Infile EigenvalFile

  or
    mri_esa -help [topic]

</pre>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>

  Suppose the input file infile.mri has dimensions xyz, with extents
  100:100:30.  Each of the 30 z's represent a different 100x100 real
  symmetric matrix.  The command:

  mri_esa -n 10 -evec eigenvectors infile eigenvalues

  will produce two new Pittsburgh MRI datasets; eigenvectors.mri and
  eigenvalues.mri .

  eigenvalues.mri will have dimensions yz, with extents 10:30 .  Each
  of the 30 z's represents the largest 10 eigenvalues of the
  corresponding 100x100 matrix.

  eigenvectors.mri will have dimensions xyz, with extents 100:10:30.
  Each of the 30 z's will contain the 10 eigenvectors (each of length
  100) corresponding to the 10 eigenvalues in eigenvalues.mri .

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>Infile</h3>
<pre>

  Infile is the input dataset.  It must have at least two dimensions,
  and the extents of the first two dimensions must be the same.  These
  two dimensions form a real symmetric matrix.  If more than two
  dimensions are present, the dataset is treated as multiple different
  real symmetric matrices and each is solved in turn.  The particular
  letter names of the dimensions don't matter.

</pre>
<h3>EigenvalueFile</h3>
<pre>

  This output file contains the nEigen eigenvalues produced by each
  solution.  By default the eigenvalues are arranged in ascending
  order, that is, smallest to largest.  If the -descend flag is
  present this order is reversed.


</pre>
<h3>EvecFile</h3>
<pre>

  -eigenvectors EvecFile	(-evc EvecFile)

  If this output file is specified, eigenvectors will be calculated;
  if not, only the eigenvalues are calculated.  nEigen eigenvectors
  are produced for each solution.  If any of these eigenvectors fail
  to converge, text error messages are generated, but the program will
  not abort.  By default the eignevectors associated with the smallest
  eigenvalues are delivered first.  If the -descend flag is present
  this order is reversed.

</pre>
<h3>number</h3>
<pre>
  -number nEigen		(-num nEigen)

  Specifies number of eigenvalues (and eigenvectors if requested) to
  calculate.  Must be less than or equal to the rank of the input
  matrix.  The default is the input rank.

</pre>
<h3>chunkname</h3>
<pre>
 -chunk Chunkname		(-chu|c Chunkname)

 Specifies the chunk that is to be operated on.
     Default value is "images".

</pre>
<h3>upper</h3>
<pre>
  -upper			(-upp)

  The symmetry of the input matrix is not checked; the algorithm
  simply uses one half of the matrix and ignores the rest.  The
  default is to use the half below the diagonal; this switch causes
  the upper half to be used instead.

</pre>
<h3>descend</h3>
<pre>
  -descend

  By default the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are delivered in
  ascending order, smallest eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors
  first; this is the behavior of the underlieing LAPACK routine.  If
  the -descend flag is given this order is reversed, and the largest
  eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors appear first.  Note that the
  set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is not effected; only their
  order in the output file changes.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>
  [-verbose]			(-ver|v)

  Requests verbose operation.

</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>
  [-debug]			(-deb)

  Requests debugging output.

</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Details</h3>
<pre>

  This program is basically just a wrapper for the LAPACK routine
  <a href="http://gams.nist.gov/serve.cgi/Module/CLAPACK/DSYEVX.C/12646/">DSYEVX</a>.  All the math is carried out in double precision, with
  conversion to and from double precision taking place on input and 
  output as needed.

  NOTE: Text error messages will be given if some of the
  eigenvectors fail to converge, but the program will not abort.
