    <h1>FIASCO</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  FIASCO is the main script that drives the noise reduction and
  analysis of an fMRI dataset.

  FIASCO [epi|spiral]

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  The Fiasco script carries out the following very simple steps:

  1) Create an output logfile with the name out/logfile, and write
     a header into it.

  2) Check for an executable file with the name arg.proc.csh, where
     arg is the argument with which it was called.  For example,
     epi fMRI data is processed by the file epi.proc.csh .  If this
     file is found, it is executed with stdout and stderr redirected
     to the logfile.  If no such file is found the script exits.

  3) Write a trailer to the log file and exit.

  The steps normally followed by the proc file are:

  1) Source fiasco.local.csh to establish environment variables
     required by Fiasco.

  2) Source arg.defaults.csh (for example, epi.defaults.csh) to
     establish the default variables for the analysis the user has
     requested.

  3) Source arg.local.csh (for example, epi.local.csh) to establish
     environment variables specific to this particular run.

  4) Create the $F_TEMP, out, and ps directories if they do not already 
     exist.

  5) If parallel execution is enabled via the F_PARALLEL environment
     environment variable in fiasco.local.csh, source the script
     $FIASCO/parallel.start.csh and exit if it reports failure.

  6) Execute the arg.steps.csh (for example, epi.steps.csh) file to
     perform the actual processing of the user's data.  This file
     contains the actual processing steps the user has selected.  

  7) If parallel execution is enabled, source
     $FIASCO/parallel.finish.csh .

<h2>Environment</h2>
<pre>

  The environment variable FIASCO must be set to point to the location
  of the Fiasco executables, and the environment variables PVM_ROOT
  and must point to the location of PVM and to the machine
  architecture type.  

  The FIASCO script will immediately source the fiasco.local.csh, 
  epi.defaults.csh, and epi.local.csh scripts (or their spiral
  equivalents), defining many more environment variables.  With the
  exception of MRI_TMP_DIR, all of these begin with "F_".
