<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

 The vmpfx module of the BRAIN software system fits a flexible
 hierarchical statistical model voxelwise to fMRI time series.
 Typically vmpfx is the first module applied to the data after
 suitable reconstruction and correction with the FIASCO software
 system.  The output of vmpfx can be used as is or can be refined with
 later system modules.  For example, the module vfpfx performs
 posterior sampling and computes a wider variety of statistics.  The
 module query (when available) will support a range of statistical
 queries from both the vmpfx and vfpfx output structures.

 This documentation is preliminary (and rough) and focuses on Version
 0.25beta.  However, because this software is changing rapidly, this
 document intertwines brief descriptions of several later versions to
 give the reader an idea of what changes to expect.

   Version  0.25beta       Preliminary and experimental version
                           bundled and compatible with initial 
                           FIASCO 4.0 Release September 1997.

   Version  0.75beta       Expected to be released in October 1997
                           Vastly optimized performance, wider model
                           support, better input/output handling,
                           and a streamlined set of features.

   Version  1.0            Expected to be released in December 1997.
                           Further performance optimization, cleaner
                           and more powerful input/output structure,
                           methods for specifying additional layers
                           in the hierarchy, ROI specification,
                           and improved interface.

<h2>Version</h2>
<pre>

 This is version vmpfx 0.25-beta.  See Introduction for description
 of future releases and varible features.


</pre>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

 vmpfx can be invoked in two ways:

 vmpfx input_file [override_options]
 vmpfx [-help [topic]]

 For the first form, the required input file is a text file describing
 the data, design, and algorithm specification using the INSPEC 0.5
 specification.  See Input-Format and Input-File.

 The override options allow command line overrides of tags
 specified in the input file, which can prove useful.
 See Usage:Overrides for further help.

 For the second form, 

  -help     Engage this help system.  With no further arguments, interactive help is
            supplied; if a topic is supplied, help for that topic is given.  If the
            topic argument is supplied as a string "topic1 topic2 ..." in quotes,
            then each topic in the list is documented.

 If no arguments are supplied, a short usage line is provided.

</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Overrides</h3>
<pre>

  Command line overrides of the input file are of the form name=value.
  The available choices are as follows:

  root=dataroot               Set root name of data file
  path=datapath               Set path of data file
  data=datafile               Set name of data (header) file
  format=dataformat           Set format of data file
  oroot=outputroot            Set output file root name
  opath=outputpath            Set output file path
  output=outputfile-name      Set output file name
  logfile=logfile-name        Set log file name
  first=voxel#                First voxel to process, indexed from 0
  last=voxel#                 Last voxel to process, indexed from 0 (-1 == all)

  
  Note:  In the beta versions, overrides can be specified by the user via &lt;arg&gt; 
         tags in the input file.  With version 1.0, this will be implemented
         differently---with some set options and a general override option,
         and the &lt;arg&gt; tag will disappear.


</pre>
<h2>Input-Format</h2>
<pre>

 The beta versions of vmpfx specify their input using the INSPEC 
 descriptor format version 0.5.  This is a general format for
 providing input information to complex applications.  It allows
 a variety of commands for representing information and dealing
 with contingencies.  A C library for processing these files
 is used by vmpfx.  

 This original version of INSPEC was an attempt to solve a longstanding
 (at least for me) problem with managing complex numerical programs.
 It allows information to be encoded, stored, and easily varied
 without rigid rules of order or format.  The C library is intended
 to make it easy to process even very complicated input information
 straightforwardly.

 However, in its first large scale use, several design weaknesses
 and unfulfilled potentials have been revealed.  Version 1.0 of
 INSPEC fixes these problems and will provide a much cleaner and
 more powerful tool, with both C and C++ implementations. 

 Formatting Basics:
 -----------------

 The input file is arranged into a series of lines of the form

 tag  value

 separated by arbitrary spaces and comments.  Here, the tag is a
 string of characters not including white space, comment characters #,
 the command open close characters &lt;&gt;, or an optional tag separator
 (by default empty but e.g., =).  Tags can be enclosed in quotes but
 need not be.  The value is the sequence of tokens until the end of a
 line.  White space separates individual tokens which thus specify
 different input values associated with tag.  Strings enclosed in
 quotes are processed and can include whitespace. Hence, the following
 are acceptable:

  foo   1 
  bar   true
  zap   1 2 3 4 5
  ick   1 hello 2.718 world 3.14 "e I pi = -1" "n"
  what  "$&lt;foo&gt; 2 $&lt;zap&gt;"       # All in one string
  hmmm  true $&lt;zap&gt; false       # Multiple values 

  The application program determines how to parse the values associated
  with each tag, but they can be arbitrary in number and type.  Lines
  can be continued by a '' preceding a newline.

  In the example above, what is associated with the single string value
  "1 2 1 2 3 4 5" while hmmm is associated with the multiple values
  true 1 2 3 4 5 false.  Thus, previously defined tags can be referenced,
  and quotes modulate how those values are combined.

  The # is the comment character.  Any text between a # and
  the end of a line is ignored; however, a comment has a replacement
  value equivalent to whitespace, so input tokens cannot be split
  by a comment.

  Tag/Values pairs in the file can be given in any order and can be separated
  by arbitrary whitespace.  Of course, tags must be defined if they are to
  have a non-trivial substitution value during input file scanning.  Undefined
  tags expand to the null string.

  Command Structures:
  ------------------

  To make processing more convenient, there are a variety of commands 
  available with reserved names.  These are all of the form

      &lt;command_name&gt;

  All multi-line commands are ended with &lt;end&gt;.

  The commands are as follows:

  &lt;append&gt; tag value              Appends value to the previously defined value of tag.
                                  If tag has not been defined, this is the same as
                                  assigning it.  Without the &lt;append&gt;, tag would be
                                  redefined.

  &lt;arg&gt; tag name                  Provides a command line over-ride alias "name="
                                  for the tag  "tag".  This can also be specified
                                  in the calling program, but was included to all
                                  end-user flexibility.  However, the &lt;arg&gt; command
                                  will be eliminated in the next version of INSPEC.

  &lt;cond&gt; tag string               Conditionally specifies value of tag.  
       string1   value1           If string == stringi, then tag is assigned value i.
          ...                     The &lt;end&gt; must be placed on its own line in version 0.5.
       stringn   valuen
  &lt;end&gt;

  &lt;data&gt; tag                      Specifies a data table associated with tag.
                                  Each column of the table must maintain the same
         X1  Y1  ...  Z1          data type.  The &lt;end&gt; must be placed on its
         X2  Y2  ...  Z2          own line in version 0.5.
            ...
         Xn  Yn  ...  Zn
  &lt;end&gt;
       

  &lt;end&gt;                           Ends a multiline command

  &lt;endinput&gt;                      Stops input processing of the file.  This is 
                                  helpful for including text information before
                                  other (e.g., binary) input information.

  &lt;include&gt; file                  Begin reading from file, continuing with current
                                  file when finished.  Note that &lt;endinput&gt; in an
                                  included file causes  

  &lt;require&gt; tag                   Causes an error to be generated during scanning 
                                  if tag has not been defined by this point.
                                  This command will be eliminated in Version 1.0.

 See Input-Format_Future for a comment on the new INSPEC 1.0 features.

</pre>
<h2>Input-Format_Future</h2>
<pre>

 INSPEC Version 1.0 will eliminate the commands  &lt;arg&gt; and &lt;require&gt;,
 and will eliminate the built-in variables $&lt;#&gt;.  New command features
 include &lt;namespace&gt;, &lt;record&gt;, &lt;binary&gt;, and &lt;class&gt;.  The &lt;namespace&gt;
 feature is particularly relevant to vmpfx, since it allows the coherent
 organization of related tags.  That is,

  &lt;namespace&gt; prefix
    tag1 value1
    tag2 value2
      ...
    tagn valuen
  &lt;end&gt;

 defines the tags prefix.tag1, prefix.tag2, ..., prefix.tagn.
 All constructs and commands can be nested within a &lt;namespace&gt;.

 The built-in variables in INSPEC 1.0 will include

      $&lt;this&gt;           file name (without path) of the input file
      $&lt;this.path&gt;      path only of input file
      $&lt;prog&gt;           current executable root
      $&lt;prog.path&gt;      path of current executeable
      $&lt;home&gt;           user's home directory
                 

</pre>
<h2>Input-File</h2>
<pre>

 The input file contains tags to specify information to the program
 on several sets of related quantities.  The tags 

 Data
 ----

 Tag             Value         Default      Description
 	   	         	      
 data.file       File Name                  Name of Data file (header)n
 data.format     Format Name   list         Data File Format (see Data-Files)

 
 I find it useful in the input file to define tags data.root and data.path
 and base.path as follows:

    base.path   /users/genovese/mri/

    data.root   rootname
    data.path   $&lt;base.path&gt;data/foo/
    data.file   $&lt;data.path&gt;$&lt;data.root&gt;.mri

 This allows a good deal of flexibility in using the same input file without
 introducing errors from multiple changes throughout the file.


 Output
 ------

 Tag               Value         Default      Description
 	   	         	      
 output.file       filename      	      Name of output file
 output.logfile    filename      	      Name of logfile
 output.append     true/false    true         Add output to existing files?

 vmpfx.produce     product list  estimates    List of output products to compute
 vmpfx.model       model spec    full         Sub-models to include in hierarchy
 vmpfx.null.model  true/false    false        Include null model? (Deprecated; use vmpfx.model) 


 If no logfile is specified, the logfile will be named output-root.log.  The binary
 file will be of the form output-root.bin in general.  The path component of the
 output file name is carried over in both cases.

 The possible products are as follows:

     estimates               parameter estimates
     standard.errors         parameter standard errors
     residuals               residuals of the model fit
     fitted.values           fitted values (data - residuals)
     diagnostics             fit diagnostics and model comparisons
     covariances             parameter covariance matrix (symmetric packed format)

 The model structure determines which responsiveness parameters are included in the model
 and which sub-models are compared in computing the posterior.  The currently supported
 model specifications are:

     full                    Include all non-fixed 
     null                    Include none
     maximal                 Include sub-models that each drop one non-fixed parameter
     all                     Include all sub-models
     full+null               Include full and null models
     null+full               Include null and full models
     all-full                Include all but full model

 In version 0.25beta, only full, null, and full+null/null+full are supported.
 The deprecated tag vmpfx.null.model determines whether or not a null model
 is to be added to the full model.  

 Design
 ------

 Tag               Value         Default      Description
 	   	         	      
 conditions        integer                    Number of experimental conditions
 design            3 col table                Condition, Task Start, and Task Length 
 design.images     0 or 1           1         Design table given in images (1=true,0=false)
 design.aligned    0 or 1           1         Tasks aligned with acquisition (1=true,0=false)
 IAI               positive        1.0        Time between (3-D) images
 fixed             integer list    empty      Conditions fixed to 0 responsiveness
 slice.offset      non-negative    0.0        Time between slices (same units as IAI)
 slice.order       integer list    empty      Slice indices in acquisition order (from 0)

 Algorithm Settings
 ------------------
 Tag                 Value         Default      Description
 	   	         	      
 vmpfx.iterations    pos integer      5000      Max # Iterations per voxel
 vmpfx.evaluations   pos integer     50000      Max # Objective Evaluations per voxel
 vmpfx.memlimit      pos integer   1048576      Output Cache Size Limit in bytes
 vmpfx.qnb.options   2 col table                List of Options to Quasi-Newton Optimizer
 vmpfx.scd.tol       pos real       1.0e-8      Tolerance for Numerical Hessian Calculation
 vmpfx.cov.method    1..4                4      Method for Hessian Calculation
 vmpfx.knots         integer             6      Number of Drift Knots to usen
 vmpfx.fix.knots     true/false       true      Fix Knot Values (true) or Allow to Vary (false)
 vmpfx.first.voxel   integer             0      Index (from 0) of first voxel processed
 vmpfx.last.voxel    integer            -1      Index (from 0) of last voxel processed (-1 == all)

 The values for covariance method correspond to

        0            Second Central Difference Direct Estimate
        1            Second Central Difference Richardson Interpolation
        2            First Centeral Difference Direct Estimate
        3            First Centeral Difference Richardson Interpolation
        4            Analytic

 Analytic is recommended.  If numerical calculation is used, the Richardson method
 is far superior.

 Note: In beta versions earlier than 0.5, only Direct and Richardson are supported, and
 the default value is 1 (Richardson).   In all beta versions, gradient first central
 differences are not yet implemented.


 Parameter Specification
 -----------------------

 Tag               Value         Default      Description
 	   	         	      
 drift.degree      integer           3        Degree of drift piecewise polynomials
 shape.params      2-8               4        Number of Shape Parameters for Bell Functions
 ramp.length       integer        8192        Length of Bell Spline Ramps (no need to change)
 paste.form        0 or 1            0        Non-additive model  (0=additive, 1=smooth_paste)
 paste.scale       pos real      0.001        Pasting Ratio (ignored if paste.form == 0)


 Priors
 ------

 Tag               Value         Default      Description
 	   	         	      
 prior.baseline     2 reals      [none] 1      Center and Spread for Baseline 
 prior.drift        3 reals      1 1 0         Drift specification (see below)
 prior.resp         2 reals      2.5e-3 50     Shift and Decay (both &gt; 0)
 prior.shape        s x 2 Table  1 1 each row  Shape and Scale (1 row per parameter, all &gt; 0)
 prior.sigmasq      2 reals      2.5 1.25      Shape and Scale for 1/sigma^2    (both &gt; 0)

 prior.drift.scaled  true/false  false        Deprecated (Scale Drift by Baseline)

 The drift specification requires three values.  The first is the prior penalty on the
 norm of the drift profile, the second is the prior penalty on the curvature of the
 drift profile, and the third is the target degrees of freedom allowed for the
 drift profile.  The values 0.001 1 5 are reasonable generic values.

 The priors for the other parameters describe the shape of the prior distribution.
 The prior.shape tag requires 1 set of parameters for each shape parameter specified.


 Initialization
 --------------

 Tag               Value         Default      Description
 	   	         	      
 vmpfx.init         list           auto        Components to explicitly initialize
 vmpfx.init.type    type name      float       Type for initializing information
 vmpfx.init.iter    integer        50          Max # Iterations for Initial Fit
 vmpfx.init.tol     real           1e-4        Change tolerance for initial fit

 For the beta versions of vmpfx, I recommend using auto initialization and the
 other initialization defaults.  Version 1.0 will handle initialization a bit
 more concisely.

</pre>
<h2>Data-Files</h2>
<pre>

 vmpfx supports several input formats.  The data should be arranged 
 with time as the fastest varying dimension since vmpfx pulls off
 one voxel time series at a time.   The formats are as follows:

   list          List Format

     This format is a generic list of voxel time series, with no required
     coordinates in space.  The file name given in the data.file is a 
     text header with the following fields:

        Tag          Value         Default      Description

        file         filename                   Data File Name
        voxels       integer                    Number of voxels
        type         type name     float        Storage type of input data
        dim.t        integer                    Extent of Time Dimension
        dim.x        integer                    Extent of x dimension  (Optional)
        dim.y        integer                    Extent of y dimension  (Optional)
        dim.z        integer                    Extent of z dimension  (Optional)
        header       integer        0           Size of header before data in bytes
        missing      string        none         Information on missing values
        image        true/false    false        Data composed of complete images.

   Unless specified with the file tag, the data file path is taken to be the same  
   as that of the header file.


   pgh-mri       Pittsburgh MRI Format

     Thanks to Joel Welling, vmpfx can read data files in the Pittsburgh MRI Format.
     The name of the header file is given for the data.file tag.

   pgh           Old Pittsburgh Format

     The old Pittsburgh format has a short header prepended to the data

   raw           Just data file

     In this case, the required information should be included in the input file,
     as follows:

        Tag               Value         Default      Description

        data.voxels       integer                    Number of voxels
        data.type         type name     float        Storage type of input data
        data.dim.t        integer                    Extent of Time Dimension
        data.dim.x        integer                    Extent of x dimension  (Optional)
        data.dim.y        integer                    Extent of y dimension  (Optional)

<h2>Output</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<pre>

 vmpfx produces three files:

   1.  Log                       Input Record and Execution Log
   2.  Output Descriptor         Text Description of Results Structure
   3.  Binary Products           Requested Products stored in binary form

 By default, these are named root.log, root.out, and root.bin respectively,
 where root is the data file name without path or extension.  The
 logfile root and the output/binary root can be set independently in
 the input file.

 vmpfx will refuse to overwrite existing files 

 See Output:Logfile, Output:Descriptor, Output:Binary for further details.

</pre>
<h3>Logfile</h3>
<pre>

 The Logfile contains a time-stamped copy of the input file for reference
 and an execution log containing any diagnostic information or error messages
 produced by the program.

 Note: Because of a poor interface design for the IMSL optimizer,
 vmpfx may redirect some internal IMSL messages to the standard error.
 Do not be alarmed.  I find it best to implement vmpfx with "&gt;&amp; vlog"
 at the end of the line to catch these (although they are useless).

</pre>
<h3>Descriptor</h3>
<pre>

 This file gives a text representation of the records stored in the
 binary results.  The header tags describe the file and list the
 volumes produced.  The subsequent tags form a hierarchy of components
 within each volume.  The type column describes the type of object,
 the size column describes the size in bytes of each object, and the
 units column describes the number of objects associated with that
 component.  The special type record indicates that a .contents field
 exists for that component.

</pre>
<h3>Binary</h3>
<pre>

 Results stored in binary format packaged as described in the Descriptor file.
