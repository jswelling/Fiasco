<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  strip_skull.py attempts to automatically strip the skull from an
  anatomical dataset, by checking for and applying external packages.

    strip_skull.py [-v] [-d] [--like OtherStrippedDS] InputDS OutputDS

  where:
    -v specifies verbose output
    -d specifies debugging output
    --like OtherStrippedDS allows the user to suggest stripping by
     the same method used for a previously stripped dataset
    InputDS is the input anatomical dataset.  
    OutputDS is the output dataset, which should correspond to the 
     input but with the skull stripped off.  If the OutputDS exists,
     it must be older than the InputDS or strip_skull.py will exit.

  or

    strip_skull.py -help [topic]

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  NOTE: If OutputDS exists and is newer than InputDS, 
  strip_skull.py will exit.  This is generally a great convenience,
  but might cause confusion if one is changing the stripping method
  while leaving the input unchanged.

  The script currently knows how to use the AFNI 3dSkullStrip and
  3dIntracranial methods, and how to read a 'hint' from a previously
  stripped dataset and apply a matching method.  The following methods
  are tried, in order:

  1) Convert to AFNI format, strip using 3dSkullStrip, and convert
     back to Pgh MRI.
  2) Convert to AFNI format, strip using 3dIntracranial, and convert
     back to Pgh MRI.
  3) Read the conversion hint from another dataset supplied with the
     '--like' option and apply it.

  After each attempt a crude reality check is performed, to make sure
  that a plausible number of voxels have been stripped off.  If the
  test is failed the program goes on to the next method, or exits with
  an error if all methods have failed.

  When a successful method is found, a hint about the method and the
  parameters used is written to the "images.skull_strip_info" tag of 
  the output dataset.
