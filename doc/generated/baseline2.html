<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

   baseline2 reads and baseline-corrects right and left images for
   two-shot catch and hold data, combines them into a single image,
   averaging the area of overlap in the middle, and pads the ends with
   zeroes.  Every second scan line is reversed.  Note that the output
   dataset has a time dimension 1/2 that of the input dataset.

   To run baseline2 use:
     baseline2 [-reverse even|odd|all|none] [-jitter floatNum] 
               [-shift intNum] [-estimates Estimates-File] infile outfile

   or:
     baseline2 -help

</pre>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>

   baseline2 infile outfile

   This use takes all the defaults:
 -est baseadj.par
 -rev none
 -shi 10

   baseline2 -est baseline.par -rev even -shi 20 infile outfile

   This use puts the raw parameter estimates in file baseline.par (at
   odds with the default use).  Line reversal is for even lines only
   (typical for coronal slices) and the shift is set to 20.
 

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>reverse</h3>
<pre>
   [-reverse even|odd|all|none]		(-rev|r Which-Lines)

   Ex: -r all

   Reverses even-numbered rows, odd rows, all rows, or  no rows
   respectively.  The default is to use any row flipping information
   available in the input dataset, or "none" if no such information 
   is available.

</pre>
<h3>jitter</h3>
<pre>
   [-jitter floatNum]			(-jit floatNum)

   Performs a jitter correction with floating point parameter floatNum
   (THIS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED).

</pre>
<h3>shift</h3>
<pre>
   [-shift intNum]			(-shi|s intNum)

   Specifies that the amount of shift (half the amount of overlap) is
   the value of intNum (which is an integer) complex units. 
   Default value is 10.

</pre>
<h3>estimates</h3>
<pre>
  [-estimates Estimates-File]		(-est|e Estimates-File)

  Ex: -e b.par

  Specifies that the location adjustment parameters should be written
  to Estimates-file. Default is "baseadj.par".


</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<pre>

  Baseline2 accepts only standard complex-valued images with dimension
  order "vxyzt" as input with a vector length of 2.

  The outfile is not allowed to have the same name as the infile. The
  default outfile is baseline.mri.

  The outfile consists of single-precision, complex-valued, floating-point
  numbers.

  Odd line reversing is typical for axial and sagittal slices; even
  line reversing is typical for coronal slices.
