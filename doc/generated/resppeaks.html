<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  Description:

  resppeaks takes a pgh MRI dataset containing a respiratory chunk
  and creates a new MRI file containing the chunk with a ramping
  function cooresponding to each break in the original file.  
  Specifically, the output chunk values run linearly from 0.0
  immediately following one inhalation maximum to 1.0 the moment 
  before the next.  Estimates are made for the values before and
  after the first and last peaks.  A second chunk (named "magnitude")
  is also added containing magnitudes for each breath.
  
  The input chunk must be a pure time series, that is, it's
  dimensions must be "t".  

  Parameters:

    resppeaks [-mc mchunk] [-c chunk] [-w window_size] [-t threshold] 
           infile outfile
 
        -mc mchunk specifies the name of the new magnitude chunk
        -c chunk specifies the name of the main input/output chunk
     to use
        -w window_size specifies the size of the window to use for
     filtering the data when looking for peaks
        -t threshold specifices the threshold to use for deciding 
        infile specifies the input dataset
        output specifies the output dataset
