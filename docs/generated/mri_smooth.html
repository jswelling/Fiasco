<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  mri_smooth takes a pgh MRI dataset of any type, and outputs
  a dataset of floating point values containing a smoothed
  version of the same data.  The smoothing operation acts on
  all chunks in the dataset except the "missing" chunk, which
  is not smoothed.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>dimension</h3>
<pre>
  [-dimension Dim]			(-dim|d Dim)

  Specify dimension over which to smooth.  Default is "t".

</pre>
<h3>bandwidth</h3>
<pre>
  [-bandwidth Band]			(-bdw Band)

  Short form of smoother "-smoother_bandwidth" switch; see
  below.  Default is 3.0 .

</pre>
<h3>threshold</h3>
<pre>
  [-threshold Thresh]			(-thr Thresh)

  Short form of smoother "-smoother_threshold" switch; see
  below.  Default is 0.0 .

</pre>
<h3>kernel</h3>
<pre>
  [-kernel Ktype]			(-ker Ktype)

  Short form of smoother "smoother_kernel" switch; see below.
  Keywords for this option are "gaussian", "triangular",
  "exponential", and "median"; default is "gaussian".  (Median 
  smoothing is not a kernel-smoothing operation, but it is still

<pre>

  -debug

  Debug mode; write debugging info to stderr.

<h3>SmootherOptions</h3>
<pre>

    -smoother_type type

       type specifies smoother type. Available options are:

              "gauss" for Gaussian kernel smoothing
              "tri"   for triangular kernel smoothing
              "pow"   for power law kernel smoothing 
              "median"for median smoothing
              "none"  to disable smoothing  
              "ddx"   a special type which produces output values equal 
                      to the change in the input from the previous sample
              "shift" a special type which produces output values equal 
                      to the input values at some nearby cell
              "linterp" a special type which produces output values which
                      are linearly interpolated between adjacent inputs
              "runningsum" a special type which produces output values equal 
                      to the previous output value plus the
                      corresponding input value

    -smoother_bandwidth band

       band (a floating point number) specifies the bandwidth used
            in smoothing.  The meaning of bandwidth depends on the
            type of smoothing used;  see below.

    -smoother_threshold thresh

       thresh (a floating point number) specifies the cutoff threshold
            for the smoothing kernel.  If a point within the smoothing
            window differs from the point being calculated by a value
            greater than the threshold, the window is truncated before
            that value on that side.  If thresh is &lt;= 0.0, this test
            is not performed and the window is not truncated.

    -smoother_k k

       k (a floating point number) specifies a constant which may be
            used in specifying the smoothing kernel.  No current 
            smoother type actually uses this value; it is present for
            future expansion.

  Unless otherwise specified for a specific function, the default type
  is Gaussian, the default bandwidth is 45.0, the default constant is 
  60.0, and the default threshold is 0.0.

<h2>SmootherCalculation</h2>
<pre>

  All kernel smoothers check for missing data points, and exclude them. 

  Kernel smoothers perform the following operations at each point
  to be smoothed.  First, a smoothing window is defined.  This
  window initially includes all of the data points.  The window is 
  then truncated using the threshold value if appropriate.  A weighted
  sum of the points remaining in the window is then calculated,
  excluding missing points.  This value is divided by the sum of the 
  weights to produce the smoothed value for the point in question.
 
  The weights used are defined by the kernel K(t), where t= x1-x2, the
  separation between the points in question.  The kernels used by the
  various kernel smoothers are:

  Gaussian:   K(t)= exp( -(t*t)/(bandwidth*bandwidth) ) 


                    1.0 - (abs(t)/bandwidth) if abs(t)&lt;=bandwidth/2
  Triangular: K(t)= 
                    0.0 otherwise
                    

  Power law:  K(t)= pow( C, abs(t) )  where C= pow(0.5,1/bandwidth), 
                                      so that bandwidth is full width
                                      at half maximum.

  Smoother type "median" replaces the input value with the median
  value in a window of total width equal to bandwidth.  "median"
  k values but respects thresholds.

  Smoother type "none" does no smoothing, simply copying its input to
  its output.

  Smoother type "ddx" produces output Y[i]= X[i]-X[i-1].  This is a
  convenient hack when derivatives are needed.  "ddx" ignores
  bandwidth, threshold, k, and all "missing" information.

  Smoother type "shift" produces output Y[i]= X[i+shift], where 
  shift=rint(bandwidth).  (rint rounds to the nearest integer).
  Values for which X[i+shift] would fall outside the range of the
  input data are set to 0.0.  "shift" ignores threshold, k, and all
  "missing" information.

  Smoother type "linterp" produces output Y[i]= (X[i-1] + X[i+1])/2
  for all i which do not lie on the boundary of the input data range.
  At the boundaries, 2-point extrapolative values are used.  For
  example, Y[0]= 2*X[1] - X[2].

  Smoother type "runningsum" produces output Y[0]= X[0], and
  Y[i]= Y[i-1]+X[i] for all i&gt;0.
