Bayesian Reponse Analysis and Inference for Neuroimaging (BRAIN) 

Beta Version 0.1  Distribution Notes
------------------------------------

This is a Beta distribution of the BRAIN software system.  This includes
the maximum posterior analysis module only; there are several other modules
forthcoming that extend the analysis and the queries that can be made.  The
name and acronym of the software are working titles and may be changed in
future releases.  Also included in the distribution are the libcrg and
mrilib functions needed to run the software.  Both of these (particularly
the latter) need will be updated before the final release.  Another
weakness is that the required spline functions are not yet implemented, so
the file ramps.txt is included.  A sample input file is also provided.

Currently, you need the IMSL and LAPACK/BLAS library to compile the
maximization module.

To make the code, edit the makefile headers, entering the correct paths.
Make the mrilib and libcrg independently and install these in an accessible
location.  Then, make vmpfx using the principle makefile.

Let me know if you have further questions.
