<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  displace takes a file of the format output by estireg.c 
  and, for each set of registration parameters, calculates
  the mean distance that a pixel is displaced by such 
  a registration

  To run displace use:
    displace [-parameters Output-parameter-file] [-xdimension xExtent] 
      [-ydimension yExtent] [-weight Weight-file] infile

  or:
    displace -help

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>estimates</h3>
<pre>
  [-estimates Output-parameter-file]    (-est|e Output-parameter-file)

  Ex: -e displaceParam.par

  Specifies that the displacement statistics should be written to
  Output-parameter-file. Default is "displace.par".

  Displacement statistics are scalar, floating-point numbers.  These
  are written in ASCII in "zt" dimension order.

</pre>
<h3>xdimension</h3>
<pre>
  [-xdimension xExtent]                       (-xdm xExtent)

  Ex: -xdm 64

  Specifies the extent of the x-dimension, xExtent, over which to
  calculate the mean displacement. Default value is 128.

</pre>
<h3>ydimension</h3>
<pre>
  [-ydimension yExtent]                       (-ydm yExtent)

  Ex: -ydm 32

  Specifies the extent of the y-dimension, yExtent, over which to calculate
  the mean displacement. Default value is 64.

</pre>
<h3>weight</h3>
<pre>
  -weight Weight-file             (-wgt|w Weight-file)

  Specifies a file of relative weights to be used when summing the
  displacements of the voxels.  This is a Pittsburgh MRI file the
  first dimensions of which must be (v)xyz .  If a v dimension is
  present, its extent must be 1.  The first image from this file is
  used to weight the voxel displacements.  For example, one might use
  the data mean or a mask of the brain to weight displacements.
  Either a weight file or the -x and -y flags must be given.  If the
  -x or -y flags are given, their arguments must agree with the
  dimensions of any weight dataset; if they are not given the
  corresponding dimensions of the weight dataset are used.  The
  default weight is of course 1.0.

</pre>
<h3>infile</h3>
<pre>
  infile

  Ex: Registration-parameter-file

  Specifies that the registration parameters are to be read from
  Registration-parameter-file. Default value is "reg.par".

  The format of Registration-parameter-file is the same as the output
  from estireg.m --- ASCII numbers of the form:

      image# slice# x-shift y-shift rotation mse
  
  These six numbers must be separated by spaces or tabs, but NOT
  carriage returns --- all six numbers must reside on the same line.

<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<pre>

 + displace calculates the mean distance that a pixel is displaced by
   a 2-D, rigid-body motion, where the mean is taken across some region
   of 2-D space.

 + Translations cause a displacement equal to the Euclidean distance
   of the translation, which is unaffected by the 2-D region 
   considered.

 + The displacement statistic is not invariant to the 2-D region
   considered with respect to rotations.  Given a fixed rotation,
   the displacement statistic increases with the size of the 
   considered 2-D region.

 + The mean distance is calculated by computing a weighted average 
   of the distance displaced over a uniform Nx by Ny grid of points.  
   The unit of the displacement statistic is the distance between to 
   adjacent points in this grid, so the units of the displacement are
   pixels.
