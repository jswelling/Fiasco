<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  estireg3d is used to perform 3-D motion estimation on a set
  of images, producing estimates of the motion.  Estimation must be
  performed on image-space data (v.extent=1).  Input data must be 
  organized as vxyzt or xyzt.  It is best to use this algorithm on 
  data that is confined to the central region of the volume;  see 
  the "Calculation" section below for details.  

  To run estireg3d use:
    estireg3d -xvoxel xv -yvoxel yv -zvoxel zv
           [-input Input-header-file] [-align Align-header-file]
           [-stdv stdv-header-file]
           [-parameters Registration-parameter-file] [-debug] [-DEBUG]
           [-algorithm alg-string]
    [...smoother options...]

  or:
    estireg3d -help 

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>xvoxel</h3>
<pre>
   -xvoxel xv                      (-x xv)

   Specifies the voxel edge length in the x direction.  This
   parameter is required.  Only the ratio of this parameter 
   with the other voxel edge length parameters is relevant.

</pre>
<h3>yvoxel</h3>
<pre>
   -yvoxel yv                      (-y yv)

   Specifies the voxel edge length in the y direction.  This
   parameter is required.  Only the ratio of this parameter 
   with the other voxel edge length parameters is relevant.

</pre>
<h3>zvoxel</h3>
<pre>
   -zvoxel zv                      (-z zv)

   Specifies the voxel edge length in the z direction.  This
   parameter is required.  Only the ratio of this parameter 
   with the other voxel edge length parameters is relevant.

</pre>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>
   [-input Input-header-file]        (-i Input-header-file)

   Ex: -input partialk.mri

   Specifies that the header for the input dataset is located
   in Input-header-file. Default value is "input.mri".
   Input-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
   as Align-header-file or Stdv-header-file.

   estireg3d accepts only align real- or complex-valued images
   with dimension order "vxyzt" or "xyzt" as input.

</pre>
<h3>align</h3>
<pre>
   [-align Align-header-file]        (-a Align-header-file)

   Ex: -align oneimage.mri

   Specifies that the header for the align dataset is located
   in Input-header-file. Default value is "align.mri".
   Align-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
   as Input-header-file or Stdv-header-file.  This is the 
   "standard" data against which input images are aligned.

   estireg3d accepts only single align real- or complex-valued images
   with dimension order "vxyzt", "vxyz", "xyz" or "xyzt" for this
   purpose.  If the t dimension is given, its extent must be 1.

</pre>
<h3>stdv</h3>
<pre>
   [-stdv Stdv-header-file]        (-s Stdv-header-file)

   Ex: -align oneimagestdv.mri

   Specifies that the header for the stdv dataset is located
   in -header-file. Default value is "stdv.mri", but this file
   will not be opened unless the minimization algorithm (see below)
   requires it.  Stdv-header-file is not allowed to have the same 
   name as Input-header-file or Align-header-file.  This is the 
   estimated standard error of Align-header-file.

   estireg3d accepts only single align real- or complex-valued images
   with dimension order "vxyzt", "vxyz", "xyz" or "xyzt" for this
   purpose.  If the t dimension is given, its extent must be 1.

</pre>
<h3>parameters</h3>
<pre>
   [-parameters Registration-parameter-file]   (-p Registration-parameter-file)

   Ex: -p reg.par
 
   Specifies that the motion correction parameters are to be
   written to Registration-parameter-file. Default value is "reg3d.par".

   The format of the Registration-parameter-file is a series of
   ASCII numbers of the form:
         image# q_x q_y q_z q_w shift_x shift_y shift_z mse
   where the q_ elements compose a unit quaternion specifying
   the rotation.  These 9 numbers must be separated by spaces
   or tabs, but NOT carriage returns- all nine numbers must reside
   on the same line.  The mse entry is ignored;  it is given for
   compatibility with other utilities.  Lines beginning with '#'
   are considered to be comments and are ignored.

<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>
   [-debug]
  
   Causes debugging output to be produced.

<h3>algorithm</h3>
<pre>
   [-algorithm alg-string]             (-alg alg-string)

   This option provides control of the algorithm by which motion
   parameters are estimated.  alg-string is a string with a number
   of components separated by commas.  Specific elements are:

      "smooth" turns on smoothing.  Smoothing parameters can be set
               using the smoother arguments described below.

      "nosmooth" turns off smoothing

      "inplane" causes alignment only in the X-Y plane (like 2D slice
               alignment, but for the whole volume)

      "noinplane" causes full 3D, 6 degree of freedom alignment.

      "rotonly" causes only the rotation to be aligned.

      "norotonly" turns off the "rotonly" option.

      "transonly" causes only the translation to be aligned.

      "notransonly" turns off the "transonly" option.

      "xonly" causes only the X-axis translation to be aligned.

      "noxonly" turns off the "xonly" option..

      "qual=[cox | sabs | ssqr | ucell]" 
               sets the quality measure used to choose shear 
               decompositions for some rotation algorithms.

      "weight=[const | inv-stdv | align | smoothalign]"
               sets the weighting scheme used in calculating the
               measure minimized by the optimization, as follows:  

           "const" causes the weight to be the summed squared 
               difference across all voxels, with all voxels 
               weighted equally.

           "inv-stdv" causes the voxels to be weighted according
               to the inverse square of the associated standard 
               deviation.  Voxels for which the stdv is below a 
               given floor (set to 1.0 at compile time) are excluded 
               from the measure to be minimized.  

           "align" causes the voxels to be weighted according to 
               the absolute value of the align dataset.

           "smoothalign" causes the voxels to be weighted according 
               to the smoothed value of the align dataset.  This is
               generally used with the "nosmooth" option.

      "inner=[trilin | shear4 | shear7 | shear13]"
               sets the rotation method used in the inner (fast)
               optimization loop, as follows: 

           "trilin" implies trilinear interpolation

           "shear4" implies four shear rotations.

           "shear7" implies seven shear rotations.

           "shear13" implies 13 shear fully symmetric rotations.

      "outer=[trilin | shear4 | shear7 | shear13]"
               as for the "inner" option, but refers to the outer,
               shorter optimization loop for which more accuracy
               is needed.

      "opt=[nelmin_t | nelmin | praxis | none]"
               Controls the optimization method. Nelder-Mead
               optimization, Nelder-Mead with a T-test cutoff,
               Praxis, or no optimization can be selected.  The
               "none" option is useful for producing MSE values
               for the initial unaligned data.

      "optol=value"
               Controls the optimizer tolerance.  The effect
               depends on optimizer type, as follows:

                 none:     value has no effect
                 praxis:   Praxis attempts to return F(X) such that if
                           X0 is the true local minimum near X, then
                           norm(X-X0)&lt;Tol +sqrt(machep)*norm(X).
                           Default is 0.000001 .
                 nelmin:   Tol sets the terminating limit for the
                           variance of function values across the 'feet'
                           of the simplex.  Default is 0.02 .
                 nelmin_t: Tol sets the terminating limit for the
                           variance of function values across the 'feet'
                           of the simplex.  Default is 0.02 .
      "opscale=value"
               Controls the optimizer scale.  (Note that this is
        distinct from the -scale parameter).  The effect
               depends on optimizer type, as follows:

                 none:     value has no effect
                 praxis:   value is the maximum allowed step size.
                           Default is 1.0 .
                 nelmin:   value sets the initial size of the simplex.
                           Default is 1.0 .
                 nelmin_t: value sets the initial size of the simplex.
                           Default is 1.0 .

      "obj=[mse | mutualinfo | jointentropy]"
               Controls the objective function of the optimization.
               "mse" implies minimization of mean squared difference;
               "jointentropy" implies minimization of the joint
               entropy between the input and 'align' images, and
               "mutualinfo" inplies maximization of the mutual
               information.

      "wtfloor=val" where val is a floating point number
               Voxels corresponding to weights less than
               wtfloor*maxWeight are ignored (where maxWeight is the
               maximum weight value).  Thus wtfloor=0.0 includes all
               voxels with non-negative weights and wtfloor=1.0
               excludes all voxels.

   The default settings are:
   "nosmooth,noinplane,norotonly,notransonly,noxonly,opt=praxis,
        weight=smoothalign,qual=ssqr,inner=shear4,outer=shear4,
        obj=mse,wtfloor=0.0"
   The optimizer tolerance and scale are the default values for the
   specified optimizer type.  Smoothing is done with a Gaussian kernel
   with bandwidth 1.0 by default.

<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<pre>

  For each image in the input data,a two level optimization algorithm 
  is used to find rotation and and translation values which minimize
  a measure of the difference between the image and a target image.
  The target image is provided in the "align" dataset; voxelwise 
  estimates of the standard deviation of the target image can be
  provided in the "stdv" dataset.

  The idea is that the inner level optimization provides rapid, rough
  estimates of alignment parameters, and the outer level produces more
  accurate values slowly.  This allows a good compromise between the 
  speed and accuracy of the two algorithms.  

  Specifically, an inner, fast method is used to produce rotated and
  translated versions of the input image for particular parameter
  estimates.  When the inner search algorithm produces an estimate
  of the alignment parameters, slower outer method is used to produce
  a version of the image data rotated and translated according to
  those estimates.  The inner algorithm is then restarted to estimate
  rotation and translation values necessary to align this moved image
  with the target.  For perfect alignment the inner algorithm will
  estimate that no additional rotation or translation are needed.
  This approach can fail if the inner method is not sufficiently
  accurate to move the estimates in the correct direction;  if this
  happens a more accurate inner method should be used.

  In the special case that the inner and outer methods are the same, 
  it becomes redundant and counterproductive to move the image twice.
  If the two methods match the outer operation is ignored and all
  the motion is implemented by the call to the inner method in the
  inner optimization loop.  The outer loop still exists, however, 
  since it helps in escaping local minima.

  The -algorithm option allows control over the inner and outer
  methods used in this process and over some additional features.
  The input and target images can be smoothed before alignment.
  The optimality measure can be calculated with or without weighting
  for voxel standard deviation.

  Some rotations and translations are performed using Fourier methods, 
  as described below.  Note that the periodic nature of these methods
  means that data carried beyond the edge of the volume will "wrap
  around" and reappear on the other side.  This means that 
  geometrically incorrect results can occur for large rotations
  or translations (typically larger than about 30 degrees' rotation).
  It is best to use this algorithm on data that is confined to the
  central region of the volume.

  Some rotations and translations are performed using trilinear
  interpolation.  This method is fast but not very accurate.  The
  boundaries of the image volumes are not correctly calculated
  using this method (in contrast to Fourier methods in which the
  boundaries wrap).  When trilinear interpolation is used, the
  software keeps track of the regions which have not been calculated
  and excludes them from the optimization measure.

  For more details on this algorithm, see Eddy, Fitzgerald, Noll ---
  "Improved Image Registration Using Fourier Interpolation", 
  Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 36-6 (Dec 1996)  ***This should get
  replaced with the new paper once it finishes existing***.

  The correct choice of objective function depends on the degree of
  similarity between the input and target images.  If they are very
  similar, the mean squared error option works well; this is the
  case when aligning multiple images of the same scan to each other.
  If the input and target are acquired with different imaging
  modalities the joint entropy or mutual information measures are
  likely to be superior.  In some cases the MSE measure will actually
  have a minimum far from the intuitively correct alignment.

  Mutual information is slightly slower to compute than joint entropy,
  but it can be more robust when misalignments are large since it
  includes the individual entropies of the input images.

<h3>CoordinateSystems</h3>
<pre>

  This section describes the 3D coordinate system used by Fiasco.
  The coordinate system is right handed, with the X-Y slices oriented
  according to the "radiological convention".

  As a specific example, consider a set of multi-slice axial scan
  data.  When a slice is viewed, the right side of the image
  corresponds to the patient's left side, and patient's nose is
  at the top of the image.  This amounts to viewing the slice as
  if one were standing at the patient's feet, looking toward the
  head.

  We choose the X axis to be horizontal, with the positive X direction
  toward the image's right (the patient's left).  The Y axis is
  vertical, with the nose pointing in the positive Y direction.  The
  right hand rule then implies that the Z axis points out of the image,
  toward the patient's feet.

  The order of data in a Pittsburgh MRI file representing a scan is
  such that low X values (image left, patient right) appear before 
  high X values (image right, patient left), and low Z values
  (the top of the head) appear before high Z values (slices closer to 
  the patient's feet).  However, note that low Y values (the back of
  the head for an axial scan) appear *after* high Y values (the nose).
  Thus the coordinate system order for the Y direction is reversed
  with respect to the data order.

  With this coordinate system convention (still assuming an axial
  scan), a positive rotation about the X axis corresponds to a nod- 
  the nose moves in the direction of the patient's feet.  A positive
  rotation about Y moves the patient's right ear (on the image's 
  left) in the direction of the feet.  A positive rotation about Z
  brings the nose in the direction of the right ear (on the image's
  left).



</pre>
<h3>FSHROT3DCalculation</h3>
<pre>

  Fourier Shifts and rotations in 3D are implemented using the 
  "fshrot3d" package.  This package decomposes a requested 
  rotation and translation into three or more shear operations
  in 3D, and implements those shears using 1D Fourier transforms.
  The elementary operations implement a shear, plus a translation
  in the shear direction.

  If the operation is a simple translation (no rotation component),
  three shearing operations implement it- one in each direction.
  Hereafter rotations R may include a translation T.  Pure rotations
  will be denoted by lowercase r, such that 

         R = T r


  If an axis-aligned rotation is requested, three shears are used.
  A fourth shear adds a translation along the rotational axis if
  necessary.
  Specifically, 

         Rz = Sz Sy Sx Sy

  where Rz is a rotation about Z, Sx is a shear in the X direction,
  and etc.  Rotations about other axes can be found by permutation
  of coordinates.

  A non-axis-aligned rotation can be implemented as four shears:

        R = Si Sj Sk Si

  where i, j, and k represent distinct (but not necessarily cyclical)
  axes X, Y, and Z.  There are 3*2*1*1=6 possible such decompositions.
  See Cox et. al., "Real-Time 3D Image Registration for Functional",
  Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 42(1999) or Welling, Eddy, and Young
  (2000) (in preparation) for details.

  The necessary coefficients for these shears are singular or 
  near-singular in some regions, however.  If this situation is
  found to occur, a correcting (pure) rotation "rc" is found which 
  shifts the rotation out of the bad region, and the rotation is 
  implemented as follows (bars denote the conjugate rotation):

        R = T r 
              __
          = T rc rc r

          = Sy Sz Sx Sy Sz Sx Sy
                                  __
  by decomposing ( rc r ) and ( T rc ) each into four shears,
  resulting in 8 shears overall.

  Note that the Fourier methods used here assume that the volume
  being treated is periodic.  As a result of this, if any shear
  carries the "interesting" part of the data beyond the edge of
  the volume, that data will reappear on the opposite edge and
  produce strange artifacts.  Thus this method is best used with
  data confined to the region near the center of the volume, and
  rotation and translation parameters that do not carry that
  data to the boundary.

  If the input data is real or is the Fourier transform of pure real
  data, and one or more of the data dimensions is even, a special
  condition applies.  The phase of the highest frequency signal along
  an even dimension cannot be calculated from the input, so that
  component of the input signal cannot be translated or rotated.

<h3>FFTAlgorithm</h3>
<pre>

  The FFTW package (available from http://www.fftw.org/) is
  used to implement the fast Fourier transforms used in this routine.
  FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) is distributed under
  the Gnu General Public License.

</pre>
<h3>FFTEnvironment</h3>
<pre>

  If the environment variable F_WISDOM_FILE is set, its value will be
  used as the basis for the name of a file in which FFTW will store
  "wisdom".  This is machine-specific information about what precise
  FFT algorithm is fastest on the specific hardware.  This information
  can then be reused, saving a couple of seconds the next time a
  program using FFTW runs.

  Because this information is machine specific, an architecture-
  specific string (usually the same as $PVM_ARCH) is appended to
  the value of F_WISDOM_FILE in forming the filename.

  In parallel runs, FFTW will create one wisdom file per processor,
  by appending processor numbers to the file name.  This is necessary
  to avoid errors due to multiple processes reading and writing the same
  file.





</pre>
<h3>LINROT3DCalculation</h3>
<pre>

  Rotation and translation by linear interpolation are implemented in
  a straightforward way.  For each grid location in the output,
  a corresponding input point is found by applying the inverse
  transformation.  The value of the input at that point is found by
  trilinear interpolation, and the output grid location is set to that 
  value.

  This algorithm fails if the input point corresponding to a given
  output grid location does not fall within the input grid.  In this
  case, the output location is set to 0.0.  A grid of boolean flags
  is maintained showing whether any given output location is invalid for
  this reason.




</pre>
<h3>NelminCalculation</h3>
<pre>

  Nelmin and nelmin_t are minimization algorithms based on the Nelder-
  Mead simplex algorithm.  See for example "Numerical Recipes in C"
  section 10.4.  These versions of the code are based on Applied 
  Statictics algorithm AS 47 (J.R.STATIST.SOC C), (1971) VOL.20, NO.3 
  by R. O'Neill, as modified in remark AS R28 by I. D. Hill.  This
  Fortran code was translated to C using "f2c" and cleaned up by hand.

  Both versions have been modified to include a "reset" routine which
  is called periodically.  The calling pattern of this routine forms
  the "outer loop" in a minimization procedure.

  Nelmin is the straight version of this routine.  Nelmin_t uses a
  T-test to determine when to exit, on the hypothesis that the bottom
  of the function to be minimized is "noisy".  When the likelyhood
  that the minimization criterion has been reached exceeds 95%, the
  routine exits.
 


</pre>
<h3>PraxisCalculation</h3>
<pre>

  Praxis is a minimization algorithm based on Powell's Method as
  modified by Brent.  See for example "Numerical Recipes in C" section
  10.5 for an introduction to Powell's Method, and "Algorithms for
  Minimization without Derivatives" by Richard P. Brent, ch. 7 
  (Prentice-Hall 1973) or Brent's 1971 thesis for details.  Praxis
  is a contraction of "principal axis".

  This particular implementation of praxis comes from the Fortran
  version available from Netlib (http://www.netlib.org/).  It was
  hand-translated into C, and the singular value decomposition
  routine was replaced with a call to the LAPACK routine DGESVD.
  Brent's "random()" routine was replaced with the standard
  drand48().  The C version is reentrant.

  This implementation has been modified to make a call to the "reset"
  routine passed it at the beginning of each outer loop iteration.  
  This routine implements the outer, slower alignment method.


</pre>
<h3>ImageEntropyCalculation</h3>
<pre>

  See for example "Mutual-Information-Based Registration of Medical
  Images: A Survey" by Pluim, Maintz, and Viergever, IEEE Transactions
  on Medical Imaging, 22.8, August 2003.

  If the bounds of the histogram are defined such that some counts fall
  outside the range, those counts are dropped and a warning message
  is produced.

  Note that a few extreme values can strongly effect the entropy by
  changing the range over which the histogram is binned.  To avoid
  this problem, specify min and max bounds for the histogram.

  When a mask is applied, samples outside the mask are simply excluded
  from the histogram and the P scores.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>SmootherOptions</h3>
<pre>

    -smoother_type type

       type specifies smoother type. Available options are:

              "gauss" for Gaussian kernel smoothing
              "tri"   for triangular kernel smoothing
              "pow"   for power law kernel smoothing 
              "median"for median smoothing
              "none"  to disable smoothing  
              "ddx"   a special type which produces output values equal 
                      to the change in the input from the previous sample
              "shift" a special type which produces output values equal 
                      to the input values at some nearby cell
              "linterp" a special type which produces output values which
                      are linearly interpolated between adjacent inputs
              "runningsum" a special type which produces output values equal 
                      to the previous output value plus the
                      corresponding input value

    -smoother_bandwidth band

       band (a floating point number) specifies the bandwidth used
            in smoothing.  The meaning of bandwidth depends on the
            type of smoothing used;  see below.

    -smoother_threshold thresh

       thresh (a floating point number) specifies the cutoff threshold
            for the smoothing kernel.  If a point within the smoothing
            window differs from the point being calculated by a value
            greater than the threshold, the window is truncated before
            that value on that side.  If thresh is &lt;= 0.0, this test
            is not performed and the window is not truncated.

    -smoother_k k

       k (a floating point number) specifies a constant which may be
            used in specifying the smoothing kernel.  No current 
            smoother type actually uses this value; it is present for
            future expansion.

  Unless otherwise specified for a specific function, the default type
  is Gaussian, the default bandwidth is 45.0, the default constant is 
  60.0, and the default threshold is 0.0.

  All kernel smoothers check for missing data points, and exclude them. 

  Kernel smoothers perform the following operations at each point
  to be smoothed.  First, a smoothing window is defined.  This
  window initially includes all of the data points.  The window is 
  then truncated using the threshold value if appropriate.  A weighted
  sum of the points remaining in the window is then calculated,
  excluding missing points.  This value is divided by the sum of the 
  weights to produce the smoothed value for the point in question.
 
  The weights used are defined by the kernel K(t), where t= x1-x2, the
  separation between the points in question.  The kernels used by the
  various kernel smoothers are:

  Gaussian:   K(t)= exp( -(t*t)/(bandwidth*bandwidth) ) 


                    1.0 - (abs(t)/bandwidth) if abs(t)&lt;=bandwidth/2
  Triangular: K(t)= 
                    0.0 otherwise
                    

  Power law:  K(t)= pow( C, abs(t) )  where C= pow(0.5,1/bandwidth), 
                                      so that bandwidth is full width
                                      at half maximum.

  Smoother type "median" replaces the input value with the median
  value in a window of total width equal to bandwidth.  "median"
  k values but respects thresholds.

  Smoother type "none" does no smoothing, simply copying its input to
  its output.

  Smoother type "ddx" produces output Y[i]= X[i]-X[i-1].  This is a
  convenient hack when derivatives are needed.  "ddx" ignores
  bandwidth, threshold, k, and all "missing" information.

  Smoother type "shift" produces output Y[i]= X[i+shift], where 
  shift=rint(bandwidth).  (rint rounds to the nearest integer).
  Values for which X[i+shift] would fall outside the range of the
  input data are set to 0.0.  "shift" ignores threshold, k, and all
  "missing" information.

  Smoother type "linterp" produces output Y[i]= (X[i-1] + X[i+1])/2
  for all i which do not lie on the boundary of the input data range.
  At the boundaries, 2-point extrapolative values are used.  For
  example, Y[0]= 2*X[1] - X[2].

  Smoother type "runningsum" produces output Y[0]= X[0], and
  Y[i]= Y[i-1]+X[i] for all i&gt;0.
