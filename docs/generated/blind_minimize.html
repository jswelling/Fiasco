<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  blind_minimize minimizes a function implemented in a separate
  script file.

    blind_minimize -script scriptFile -start startPointString 
           [-algorithm algString] [-scale scaleVal] [-debug]

  or

    blind_minimize -help [subtopic]

</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>script</h3>
<pre>

  -script scriptFile

  specifies the name of the script file (or other executable) to be
  used to calculate the function value for a given vector of input
  values.  The script will be called with a series of floating point
  numbers as input.  Its output must be a single line, and the first
  token on that line must be parsable as a floating point number.
  The rest of the output line is ignored.

</pre>
<h3>start</h3>
<pre>

  -start startPointString

  specifies a string consisting of one or more floating point numbers
  separated by spaces, for example "0.1 1.2 2.3".  The number of 
  entries in the string determines the dimensionality of the
  minimization, and the values of the entries determine the starting
  point of the search.

</pre>
<h3>scale</h3>
<pre>

  -scale scaleVal

  specifies a floating point number with which to scale the function
  output.  This does not change the location of the minimum, but some
  optimization methods (nelmin and nelmin_t) are sensitive to the
  scale of the input.  Increasing the scale will cause these methods
  to run longer and to produce more accurate results.

</pre>
<h3>algorithm</h3>
<pre>

   -algorithm algString             (-alg algString)

   This option provides control of the algorithm used for
   minimization.  algString is a string with components separated 
   by commas.  At the moment, there is only one component:

      "opt=[nelmin_t | nelmin | praxis | none]"
               Controls the optimization method. Nelder-Mead
               optimization, Nelder-Mead with a T-test cutoff,
               Praxis, or no optimization can be selected.  The
               "none" option is useful for producing MSE values
               for the initial data.
     "optol=value"
               Controls the optimizer tolerance.  The effect
               depends on optimizer type, as follows:

                 none:     value has no effect
                 praxis:   Praxis attempts to return F(X) such that if
                           X0 is the true local minimum near X, then
                           norm(X-X0)&lt;Tol +sqrt(machep)*norm(X).
                           Default is 0.000001 .
                 nelmin:   Tol sets the terminating limit for the
                           variance of function values across the 'feet'
                           of the simplex.  Default is 0.02 .
                 nelmin_t: Tol sets the terminating limit for the
                           variance of function values across the 'feet'
                           of the simplex.  Default is 0.02 .
     "opscale=value"
               Controls the optimizer scale.  (Note that this is
        distinct from the -scale parameter).  The effect
               depends on optimizer type, as follows:

                 none:     value has no effect
                 praxis:   value is the maximum allowed step size.
                           Default is 1.0 .
                 nelmin:   value sets the initial size of the simplex.
                           Default is 1.0 .
                 nelmin_t: value sets the initial size of the simplex.
                           Default is 1.0 .

   The default settings are:
   "opt=praxis,"
   The optimizer tolerance and scale are the default values for the
   given optimizer type.

</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>

  -debug

  This flag causes debugging output to be written.  One can watch the
  optimization converge.

</pre>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>

  Suppose the file calc.csh contains the following:

  #! /bin/csh -ef
  mri_counter -e 1 junk
  mri_rpn_math -o junk2 
    '0,'$1',1,-,dup,*,'$2',2,-,dup,*,+,'$3',3,-,dup,*,+,1,if_print_1' 
    junk

  This script takes 3 parameters and returns the summed squared
  distance from the point given by the 3 parameters to the point
  (1,2,3).  For example,

  &gt; ./calc.csh 1.0 1.0 1.0

  returns '5'. (The &gt; is the command line prompt).  To find the
  minimum of this function using blind_minimize, the command and its
  output would be:

  &gt; blind_minimize -script "./calc.csh" -start "0.1 1.2 2.3"
  # $Id: blind_minimize_help.help,v 1.3 2005/06/01 19:53:20 welling Exp $
  # algorithm: opt=praxis,
  Final: 1 2 3 -&gt; 0
  # Optimization complete in 0.010000u 0.010000s

  The line marked Final shows the coordinates of the minimum and the
  return value of the function at that point.

<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>NelminCalculation</h3>
<pre>

  Nelmin and nelmin_t are minimization algorithms based on the Nelder-
  Mead simplex algorithm.  See for example "Numerical Recipes in C"
  section 10.4.  These versions of the code are based on Applied 
  Statictics algorithm AS 47 (J.R.STATIST.SOC C), (1971) VOL.20, NO.3 
  by R. O'Neill, as modified in remark AS R28 by I. D. Hill.  This
  Fortran code was translated to C using "f2c" and cleaned up by hand.

  Both versions have been modified to include a "reset" routine which
  is called periodically.  The calling pattern of this routine forms
  the "outer loop" in a minimization procedure.

  Nelmin is the straight version of this routine.  Nelmin_t uses a
  T-test to determine when to exit, on the hypothesis that the bottom
  of the function to be minimized is "noisy".  When the likelyhood
  that the minimization criterion has been reached exceeds 95%, the
  routine exits.
 


</pre>
<h3>PraxisCalculation</h3>
<pre>

  Praxis is a minimization algorithm based on Powell's Method as
  modified by Brent.  See for example "Numerical Recipes in C" section
  10.5 for an introduction to Powell's Method, and "Algorithms for
  Minimization without Derivatives" by Richard P. Brent, ch. 7 
  (Prentice-Hall 1973) or Brent's 1971 thesis for details.  Praxis
  is a contraction of "principal axis".

  This particular implementation of praxis comes from the Fortran
  version available from Netlib (http://www.netlib.org/).  It was
  hand-translated into C, and the singular value decomposition
  routine was replaced with a call to the LAPACK routine DGESVD.
  Brent's "random()" routine was replaced with the standard
  drand48().  The C version is reentrant.

  This implementation has been modified to make a call to the "reset"
  routine passed it at the beginning of each outer loop iteration.  
  This routine implements the outer, slower alignment method.
