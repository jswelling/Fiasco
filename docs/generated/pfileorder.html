<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  pfileorder is used to reorder pfile names, correcting for
  wrap-around in file numbering.  pfileorder is used to create
  an appropriate list of filenames for input to the spiral
  reconstruction routines.

  pfileorder reference_filename all_filenames...

  e.g. pfileorder reffile `ls P*`

  prints list to stdout.  On error no output is produced.

  pfileorder -help [topic]

  Command Line Options (see Usage:flag)

  -help   Engage help system, providing help on topic, if supplied,
            or starting the interactive help system otherwise.


  pfileorder takes a reference file name and an arbitrarily 
  ordered list of filenames including the reference filename.
  The list of filenames (*including* the reference filename)
  is printed out in numerical order, starting with the first
  filename greater than the reference file name and continuing
  in ascending order.  When the maximum filename is reached,
  the output wraps around to include filenames less than the
  reference filename.  
  in numerical order, starting with the first filename
  than the reference file name and continuing in ascending
  order and wrapping around to include filenames &lt; the
  reference file name at the end.

  This code is designed to handle a single wrap case,
  where the correct ordering of files might be:

     P30000 P40000 P50000 P60000 P00000 P10000

  it does _NOT_ handle a possible double wrap case where
  the correct ordering is

     P30000 P40000 P50000 P60000 P00000 P10000 P35000
