    <h1>pooled_stdv.csh</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  This script produces pooled stdv data from individual condition data
  with included counts and DOF information, of the sort commonly
  produced by the Fiasco "stats" tool.

  pooled_stdv.csh [-out outfile] Stdv_1 [ Stdv_2 ... ]

  or

  pooled_stdv.csh -help [topic]

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<pre>

  -out outfile

  ex: -out stat/Stdv_all

  specifies the name of the output dataset.  The default is "PooledStdv".

  
</pre>
<h2>Calculation</h2>
<pre>

  For Fiasco statistical summary data, the number of counts associated 
  with a value is stored in a chunk named "counts" in the same
  dataset.  Typically the counts value varies over slices but is
  constant within a slice.  This is the format expected by this
  script.

  Let S(i) be the stdv of some voxel in input file i, and N(i) is
  the corresponding number of counts, and 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n.
  The result produced by this script is:

                                    2
                     sum( (N(i)-1)*S (i) )
     S       = sqrt( --------------------- )
      pooled            sum( N(i) ) - n

  where the sums run over all i.  The associated DOF are given as
  the sum of the degrees off freedom associated with the individual
  S(i).  

  <b>NOTE</b> that this calculation does not include the standard
  deviation of the associated means; in other words it is done as if
  for a T test of the equality of the means.  

  <b>NOTE</b> also that this script reports DOF as 

    DOF = sum( N(i) ) - n

  while the pooled_mean.csh script reports DOF=1 for the pooled mean.  

</pre>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>

  To produce a pooled stdv from all of the condition stdvs in the
  subdirectory "stat", do:

    pooled_stdv.csh -out stat/Stdv_all stat/Stdv_*.mri
