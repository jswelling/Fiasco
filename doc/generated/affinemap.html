<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  affinemap is a fiarly stupid little program for warping one image
  onto another based on 3 points identified in both images.

  affinemap -p protofile -i infile -h outfile -[verbose] [-fourier]

  Only the "images" chunk is mapped.  Images must be real and one
  slice, so their dimension string is xy.

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>p</h3>
<pre>

  -p protofile

  This dataset provides the "shape" of the output.  It may be the same
  as "infile".

</pre>
<h3>i</h3>
<pre>

  -i infile

  This is the input dataset.

</pre>
<h3>h</h3>
<pre>

  -h outfile

  This is the output dataset.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>

  -verbose                     (-v)

  Produces verbose output.

</pre>
<h3>fourier</h3>
<pre>

  -fourier

  Causes Fourier interpolation to be used, instead trilinear
  interpolation.  Trilinear interpolation is much faster.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  The (X,Y) coordinates of the points to be matched are based on
  the origin being at the first pixel in the image file, so that
  the pixel position increases as either X or Y increase.  Looking
  at a typical Postscript representation of a Fiasco image, the
  origin of these coordinates is the top left corner of the image.
  Note that this is not the same as the standard 3D spatial coordinate
  system in Fiasco, which has its origin at the bottom left. The
  use of the top left corner for pixel (0,0) is intended to simplify
  point selection in 2D.

  Note also that the Fourier interpolation method can cause multiple
  copies of the input image to appear if the affine mapping is chosen
  poorly.  The duplicate images are from other parts of Fourier
  transform space, which is tiled with an infinite square array of
  copies of the image.  To avoid these images, avoid picking mappings
  which contract the image or pad up the original image with mri_pad.

  For Fourier interpolation, things will run more quickly if the image
  edge dimensions are powers of 2.  Padding the input image up with 0.0's
  may actually speed up the mapping process.
