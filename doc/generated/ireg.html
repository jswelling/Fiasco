<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  ireg is used to perform 2-D motion correction on a set
  of images, given estimates of the motion.  The image pixels
  are assumed to be square in the x-y direction.

  To run ireg use:
    ireg [-input Input-header-file] [-headerout Output-header-file]
         [-dataout Output-data-file]
         [-parameters Registration-parameter-file]

  or:
    ireg -help


</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>
   [-input Input-header-file]        (-i Input-header-file)

   Ex: -i baseline.mri

   Specifies that the header for the input dataset is located
   in Input-header-file. Default value is "input.mri".
   Input-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
   as Output-header-file.

   ireg accepts only standard real- or complex-valued images
   with dimension order "vxyzt" or "xyzt" as input.

</pre>
<h3>headerout</h3>
<pre>
   [-headerout Output-header-file]  (-h Output-header-file)

   Ex: -h iregOutput.mri

   Specifies that the header for the output dataset should
   be written to Output-header-file. Default value is "ireg.mri".
   Output-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
   as Input-header-file.

</pre>
<h3>dataout</h3>
<pre>
   [-dataout Output-data-file]      (-d Output-data-file)

   Ex: -d iregOutput.dat

   Specifies that the output data should be written to Output-data-file.
   Default value is the value of headerout with the ".dat" file
   extension. 

   The output dataset will consist of single-precision, floating-point
   values of the same vector length as the input dataset.

</pre>
<h3>parameters</h3>
<pre>
   [-parameters Registration-parameter-file]   (-p Registration-parameter-file)

   Ex: -p reg.par

   Specifies that the motion correction parameters are to be
   read from Registration-parameter-file. Default value is "reg.par".

   The format of Registration-parameter-file is as that
   output by estireg.m --- ASCII numbers of the form:
         image# slice# x-shift y-shift rotation mse
   These six numbers must be separated by spaces of tabs, but
   NOT carriage returns --- all six numbers must reside on
   the same line.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<pre>

  The 2-D motion correction for an image is performed via Fourier
    interpolation.  That is, translations are performed by applying
    the Fourier transform, applying a linear phase change across
    the image, and then applying the inverse Fourier transform.
    Rotations are performed via three shearing transformations,
    which use a Fourier transform, location-varying linear phase
    change, inverse Fourier transform algorithm.
  For more details on this algorithm, see Eddy, Fitzgerald, Noll ---
    "Improved Image Registration Using Fourier Interpolation", 
    Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 36-6 (Dec 1996)

<h3>FFTAlgorithm</h3>
<pre>

  The FFTW package (available from http://www.fftw.org/) is
  used to implement the fast Fourier transforms used in this routine.
  FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) is distributed under
  the Gnu General Public License.

</pre>
<h3>FFTEnvironment</h3>
<pre>

  If the environment variable F_WISDOM_FILE is set, its value will be
  used as the basis for the name of a file in which FFTW will store
  "wisdom".  This is machine-specific information about what precise
  FFT algorithm is fastest on the specific hardware.  This information
  can then be reused, saving a couple of seconds the next time a
  program using FFTW runs.

  Because this information is machine specific, an architecture-
  specific string (usually the same as $PVM_ARCH) is appended to
  the value of F_WISDOM_FILE in forming the filename.

  In parallel runs, FFTW will create one wisdom file per processor,
  by appending processor numbers to the file name.  This is necessary
  to avoid errors due to multiple processes reading and writing the same
  file.
