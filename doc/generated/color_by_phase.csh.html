    <h1>color_by_phase.csh</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  color_by_phase.csh produces a color image from a complex Pgh MRI
  file.  The intensity of the image pixels represents magnitude;
  the color represents complex phase (red being real).  The input
  file must have dimensions vxy(z)(t), and the extent of v must be 2.

    color_by_phase.csh [-b] [-d] [-r] [-g] [-png] filename

  or

    color_by_phase.csh -help [topic]

  The output file has the name filename.ps, or filename.png if
  the -png option is given.

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<pre>

  -b  brightens the image
  -d  dims the image
  -r  reverses black and white, blue and yellow, etc.
  -p  produces PNG rather than postscript.

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  The RGB colors generated are produced by treating the magnitude and
  phase of the input as the value and hue components of an HSV
  color, with saturation 1.  See "Computer Graphics Principles and 
  Practice" by Foley, van Dam, Feiner, and Hughes, chapter 13, for
  information on the HSV color system and for the algorithm used
  to implement HSV-&gt;RGB conversion.

  If the input dataset is byte data (type uchar8) the magnitude is
  scaled within an assumed range of 0 to 255; otherwise the maximum
  and minimum magnitudes are found and the magnitude is scaled between
  them.  The resulting scaled magnitude with value between 0.0 and 1.0
  serves as the HLS lightness.
  
  Intermediate files are produced in a directory with a name like
  color_by_phase_tmp_??? where ??? is some integer (specifically the 
  process ID).  This directory will be in $F_TEMP, or in the local
  directory if the environment variable F_TEMP is not defined.  If
  color_by_phase.csh should fail for any reason you will want to delete 
  that directory.  If color_by_phase.csh finishes normally, it will clean 
  up the directory.
