<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  iwarp is used to perform 3-D Affine or projective warping on a 
  set of images, given estimates of the warp.  The input images must
  be in image space (v.extent=1), not k-space. Input data must be organized
  as (v)xyz(t).  

  To run iwarp use:
    iwarp -xvoxel xv -yvoxel yv -zvoxel zv
           [-input Input-header-file] [-headerout Output-header-file]
           [-parameters Registration-parameter-file] [-verbose] [-debug]
           [-interp interpMode]

  or:
    iwarp -help 

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>xvoxel</h3>
<pre>
   -xvoxel xv                      (-x xv)

   Specifies the voxel edge length in the x direction.  This
   parameter is required.  Only the ratio of this parameter 
   with the other voxel edge length parameters is relevant.

</pre>
<h3>yvoxel</h3>
<pre>
   -yvoxel yv                      (-y yv)

   Specifies the voxel edge length in the y direction.  This
   parameter is required.  Only the ratio of this parameter 
   with the other voxel edge length parameters is relevant.

</pre>
<h3>zvoxel</h3>
<pre>
   -zvoxel zv                      (-z zv)

   Specifies the voxel edge length in the z direction.  This
   parameter is required.  Only the ratio of this parameter 
   with the other voxel edge length parameters is relevant.

</pre>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>
   [-input Input-header-file]        (-i Input-header-file)

   Ex: -input partialk.mri

   Specifies that the header for the input dataset is located
   in Input-header-file. Default value is "input.mri".
   Input-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
   as Output-header-file.

   iwarp accepts only standard real- or complex-valued images
   with dimension order "vxyzt" or "xyzt" as input.

</pre>
<h3>headerout</h3>
<pre>
   [-headerout Output-header-file]  (-h Output-header-file)

   Ex: -h 3dOutput.mri

   Specifies that the header for the output dataset should
   be written to Output-header-file. Default value is
   "iwarp.mri. Output-header-file is not allowed to have the same
   name as Input-header-file. 

</pre>
<h3>parameters</h3>
<pre>
   [-parameters Registration-parameter-file]   (-p Registration-parameter-file)

   Ex: -p reg.par
 
   Specifies that the motion correction parameters are to be
   read from Registration-parameter-file. Default value is "warp.par".

   The format of the Registration-parameter-file is a series of
   ASCII numbers of the form:
         image# v00 v01 v02 v03 v10 v11 v12 v13 ... mse
   where there are 16 'v' entries in all, representing the 16 entries 
   in a 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrix.  All non-singular
   transformations are supported, including projective as well as
   affine transformation.

   These 18 numbers must be separated by spaces or tabs, but NOT
   carriage returns- all 18 numbers must reside on the same line.  The
   mse entry is ignored; it is given for compatibility with other
   utilities.  Lines beginning with '#' are considered to be comments
   and are ignored.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>
   [-verbose]                              (-v)
  
   Causes verbose output to be produced.

</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>
   [-debug]
  
   Causes debugging output to be produced.

</pre>
<h3>interp</h3>
<pre>
  [-interp interpMode]

  Specifies interpolation mode.  Appropriate modes include
  "closest", "linear", "catmullrom", "bspline", and "bezier";
  the default is "linear".

</pre>

<h3>CoordinateSystems</h3>
<pre>

  This section describes the 3D coordinate system used by Fiasco.
  The coordinate system is right handed, with the X-Y slices oriented
  according to the "radiological convention".

  As a specific example, consider a set of multi-slice axial scan
  data.  When a slice is viewed, the right side of the image
  corresponds to the patient's left side, and patient's nose is
  at the top of the image.  This amounts to viewing the slice as
  if one were standing at the patient's feet, looking toward the
  head.

  We choose the X axis to be horizontal, with the positive X direction
  toward the image's right (the patient's left).  The Y axis is
  vertical, with the nose pointing in the positive Y direction.  The
  right hand rule then implies that the Z axis points out of the image,
  toward the patient's feet.

  The order of data in a Pittsburgh MRI file representing a scan is
  such that low X values (image left, patient right) appear before 
  high X values (image right, patient left), and low Z values
  (the top of the head) appear before high Z values (slices closer to 
  the patient's feet).  However, note that low Y values (the back of
  the head for an axial scan) appear *after* high Y values (the nose).
  Thus the coordinate system order for the Y direction is reversed
  with respect to the data order.

  With this coordinate system convention (still assuming an axial
  scan), a positive rotation about the X axis corresponds to a nod- 
  the nose moves in the direction of the patient's feet.  A positive
  rotation about Y moves the patient's right ear (on the image's 
  left) in the direction of the feet.  A positive rotation about Z
  brings the nose in the direction of the right ear (on the image's
  left).

<h3>Interpolator</h3>
<pre>

  The Interpolator package supports a number of interpolation
  algorithms.  All are implemented in a 'seperable' fashion, meaning
  that for multi-dimensional interpolation the different dimensions
  are interpolated in separate steps.  Each step interpolates a series
  of samples taken at regular intervals along a grid line.

  </tr>
  </table>

  N is the number of sample points which contribute to a given output
  value; for example, the output of the "closest" method depends only
  on the value of the nearest input sample.

  Continuity is the number of continuous derivative.  The "closest"
  method produces discontinuous output and thus has no continuous
  derivatives.  The "linear" method performs linear interpolation
  between the nearest two input points, and thus is continuous but
  has no continuous derivatives.

  Note that the "bspline" method is the smoothest with two continuous
  derivatives, but that the price of this is that the input values 
  are not interpolated.  What this means is that if you ask this
  interpolation method to return the values at the locations of the
  input points, the output values will *not* be equal to the input 
  values.  Nevertheless, this is the interpolation method recommended
  by Unser et al. (see below) for implementing rotation with this 
  order of interpolant.

  Methods listed as having a 'tension' support an additional degree
  of freedom corresponding vaguely to the stiffness of a natural 
  spline.  If a tension is supported, the default value is given.
  The specific application in use may or may not support changing 
  this value.

  For a nice treatment of interpolation in the context of rotation,
  see Unser, Thevenaz, and Yaroslavsky, IEEE Transactions on Image 
  Processing, 4.10, 1995

  Computer Graphics Principles and Practice by Foley, van Dam, Feiner,
  and Hughes provides a good introduction to spline curves, including
  the weight functions used by the spline interpolators in this package.
