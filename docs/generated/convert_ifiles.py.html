<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  This script is run in a directory full of GE LX Image subdirectories
  to produce Pgh MRI datasets from the images.

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  Suppose a scan session consists of 4 series: a setup series, an
  axial structural, an inplane structural, and a functional series.  
  The directory containing the subdirectories with the GE image files
  from this session would have a number of subdirectories with 
  names like 001, 002, 003, 004, 024, 044, etc., each of which would
  contain some number of files with names like I.001, I.002, etc.,
  possibly up to I.999.  The images of the functional scan might be
  spread over multiple directories, for example 004, 024, 044, etc.

  When run in the directory containing these subdirectories, 
  convert_ifiles.py does the following:

   -renumber_ifiles.py is used to produce subdirectories containing
    links to all the images for each particular series.

   -smartreader is used to generate Pgh MRI datasets for each
    particular series.

   -Datasets which are identified as representing multiple times
    (for example, functional datasets) have their first (guide)
    volumes clipped off.

  The result is a collection of datasets named series1.mri,
  series2.mri, etc., which can then be processed with Fiasco tools.

  <b>Note</b> that if smartreader doesn't identify a long
  collection of images as being a time series of volumes, manual
  intervention may be required to convert the dataset from a huge
  stack of slices to the correct time series.  This can happen if
  the slices in a stack are skewed or some are lost, for example.
