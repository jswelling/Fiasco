<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  Given a dataset in time series order and a mask selecting some
  subset of the voxels in the dataset, plot_roi_event_response.py
  generates a Postscript plot of the response of the voxes
  within the ROI to a set of stimulus events.

   plot_roi_event_response.py [-v][-d] [--title TitleString]
      [--bars BarLocString] [--autobars] [--window WindowLength]
      -r RoiMaskDS --out Output.ps --bps binsPerSec --ttl timeToLive
      --phrase eventIdentifierPhrase --iqr --nosamp 
      key1=val1 key2=val2 ... InFile

  where
    -v specifies verbose output
    -d specifies debugging output
    --title TitleString provides an overall title for the graph.
    --bars BarLocString accepts a comma-separated list of bar
      locations as a parameter string.  Vertical bars are drawn
      at these locations to help with identifying things like trial
      boundaries.
    -r RoiMaskDS specifies the name of the ROI mask, a dataset in
      (v)xyz(t) order.
    --out Output.ps specifies the name of the output file (default
      plot.ps)
    --bps binsPerSec specifies the number of bins per second into
      which sample values should be collected when building the
      trendline.  The default is 2.0, for a bin width of 1/2.0 sec.
    --ttl timeToLive specifies the number of seconds to associate
      samples with an event after it occurs.  Note that this is 
      typically greater than the duration of a trial!  The default is 10.0.
    --phrase eventIdentifierPhrase is a key phrase used to identify
      which stimuli in the stimulus time series of this experiment
      are to be tracked as events.  For example, --phrase "Cue"
      would identify as events stimuli named "conCue",
      "CueTheTrumpets", or "someCueHere".  Note that matching is case
      sensitive!  The default phrase is "Stim".
    --iqr causes lines for the Q1 and Q3 scores of each binned
      stimulus response curve to be drawn, rather than a single line
      for the median.
    --nosamp supresses the drawing of individual summary samples.
      This reduces the clutter on the graph and is useful with --iqr.
    key1=val1, etc. are key-value pairs that are passed to 
      customize_local.py to fully specify the experimental stimulus
      sequence.  They must come after other arguments but before
      InFile.
    InFile is the input dataset, which must be in (v)txyz order.

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>

  Suppose one had a standard Fiasco timeseries dataset named
  "tshifted" in vtxyz order, and that this dataset has been corrected
  for slice timing as with afni_tshift.py.  Suppose there is a
  matching boolean ROI dataset named "roi", as might be created by
  the "pullback_roi.py" utility.  

  Suppose that two of the event types in the stimulus time series for
  this run are called "ConStim" and "InconStim".  There might be
  others the names of which did not include "Stim", the default 
  --phrase value.

  If customize_local.py could calculate the stimulus time series 
  given the additional values for "subj", "task", "runnum", and "db_uname", 
  one could produce an output plot named "test.ps" with the command:

    plot_roi_event_response.py -v --title "My sample plot" -r roi 
      --out test.ps --bars '3.5,7.0' --bps 2 --ttl 10.0 
      subj=17 task=arrow runnum=1 db_uname=welling tshifted

  The --bars option adds two vertical bars to the plot.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  This script uses the functionality of customize_local.py to learn
  the stimulus sequence for the experiment.  This means that 
  customize_local.py must know about this particular experiment, and
  that needed additional information like subject number and database
  access information must be provided as key-value pairs.

  Given the stimulus time sequence, the calculation proceeds as
  follows:

   -The time courses of all the voxels within the ROI are extracted
    from the input datafile.
   -A summary value, currently the median, is calculated for the ROI
    at each time.
   -The stimulus sequence is scanned for relevant events using the
    --phrase command line argument.  Each such event remains active
    for --ttl seconds after it occurs.  During that time, each time
    sample (an ROI median, for example) is associated with the event.
    In each case, the sample is scaled by the value of the first 
    sample in this particular occurance of the event to adjust for
    slow drift in the fMRI signal.
   -All active events are retired at the end of each acquisition (as
    signaled by the acq_blocks chunk of the input dataset).
   -This produces a short list of events, each of which collects many
    samples at several times.  
   -For each event, samples are binned in time according to the --bps
    value, and a summary value for each bin (currently the median) is
    calculated.
   -The output plot is produced by running R as a subprogram.
   
  The output plot shows the time course of each event type,
  including the line of binned values and scatterplot points for
  each individual ROI summary value.  

  NOTE that if the --ttl value is greater than the duration of a
  single trial, each TR of the input dataset may contribute a sample
  to more than one event time series!

  NOTE that you may want to correct the input dataset for slice
  acquisition timing, as with the afni_tshift.py utility, before
  passing it as input to this script!
