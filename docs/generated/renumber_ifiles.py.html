<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  This script is run in a directory full of GE LX Image subdirectories
  to produce subdirectories of links, one subdirectory for each
  series.

  renumber_ifiles.py [-v] [-d]

    -v specifies verbose output
    -d specifies debugging output

  or

  renumber_ifiles.py -help [topic]

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  Suppose a scan session consists of 4 series: a setup series, an
  axial structural, an inplane structural, and a functional series.
  The directory containing the subdirectories with the GE image files
  from this session would have a number of subdirectories with 
  names like 001, 002, 003, 004, 024, 044, etc., each of which would
  contain some number of files with names like I.001, I.002, etc.,
  possibly up to I.999.  The images of the functional scan might be
  spread over multiple directories, for example 004, 024, 044, etc.

  Running renumber_ifiles.py in the directory containing all of 
  these subdirectories would produce new subdirectories with the
  names 'series1_links', 'series2_links', etc..  Each would contain
  symbolic links with names like I.0001 (note the extra 0) linked to
  the corresponding image in the appropriate original subdirectory.
  These link subdirectories can then be used as input to smartreader
  or other programs.
