<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  recon applies the 2-D (inverse) Fourier transform
    to a set of images

  recon [-input Input-header-file] [-headerout Output-header-file]
        [-dataout Output-data-file] [-direction Which-transform]
        [-recon Output-form]

  recon -help [topic]

  Command Line Options (see Usage:flag)

  -help   Engage help system, providing help on topic, if supplied,
            or starting the interactive help system otherwise.

</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>

  -input Input-header-file        (-i Input-header-file)

     Specifies that the header for the input dataset is located
       in Input-header-file.
     Default value is "input.mri".
     Input-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
       as Output-header-file.

     recon.m accepts only standard complex-valued images with
       dimension order "vxyzt" as input.

</pre>
<h3>headerout</h3>
<pre>

  -headerout Output-header-file  (-h Output-header-file)

     Specifies that the header for the output dataset should
       be written to Output-header-file.
     Default value is "recon.mri".
     Output-header-file is not allowed to have the same name
       as Input-header-file.

</pre>
<h3>dataout</h3>
<pre>

  -dataout Output-data-file      (-d Output-data-file)

     Specifies that the output data should be written to Output-data-file.
     Default value is ".dat".

     The output dataset will consist of single-precision, floating-point
       numbers of vector length 2 if Output-form is "complex" or vector
       length 1 otherwise.

</pre>
<h3>direction</h3>
<pre>

  -direction Which-transform       (-dir Which-transform)

     Specifies which Fourier transform (forward or inverse) should
       be used.
     If the value of Which-transform is "forward" or 1, then the
       forward transform is used, otherwise the inverse transform.
     Default value is "inverse".

</pre>
<h3>recon</h3>
<pre>

  -recon Output-form             (-r Output-form)

     Specifies whether output should be complex-valued or the 
       modulus or phase of the Fourier transformed images.
     Acceptable values for Output-form are "complex", "phase",
       and "modulus".
     Default value is "modulus".

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>FFTAlgorithm</h3>
<pre>

  The FFTW package (available from http://www.fftw.org/) is
  used to implement the fast Fourier transforms used in this routine.
  FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) is distributed under
  the Gnu General Public License.

</pre>
<h3>FFTEnvironment</h3>
<pre>

  If the environment variable F_WISDOM_FILE is set, its value will be
  used as the basis for the name of a file in which FFTW will store
  "wisdom".  This is machine-specific information about what precise
  FFT algorithm is fastest on the specific hardware.  This information
  can then be reused, saving a couple of seconds the next time a
  program using FFTW runs.

  Because this information is machine specific, an architecture-
  specific string (usually the same as $PVM_ARCH) is appended to
  the value of F_WISDOM_FILE in forming the filename.

  In parallel runs, FFTW will create one wisdom file per processor,
  by appending processor numbers to the file name.  This is necessary
  to avoid errors due to multiple processes reading and writing the same
  file.
