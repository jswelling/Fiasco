<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  estireg estimates the parameters of within-slice, 2-D, rigid-body
  motions of a sequence of images with respect to a given fixed
  image.  The image pixels are assumed to be square in the x-y
  direction.


  To run estireg use:
    estireg [-input Input-Header-File] [-parameters Parameter-File]
            [-fixed Fixed-Image-Number] [-align Target-Header-File]

  or:
    estireg -help


</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>input</h3>
<pre>
   [-input Input-Header-File]    (-i Input-Header-File)

   Ex: -i Detrend.mri

   Specifies the header file (.mri file) for the input dataset is
   Input-Header-File. Default value is "input.mri".

   estireg accepts only standard real-valued images with dimension
   order "vxyzt" or "xyzt" as input. 

</pre>
<h3>parameters</h3>
<pre>
   [-parameters Parameter-File]    (-p Parameter-File)

   Ex: -p Estimate.par

   Specifies that the estimated registration parameters should be
   written to Parameter-file. Default is "reg.par".

   Parameter-File is written as a sequence of ASCII numbers, with each
   line containing six space-delimited numbers corresponding to a
   single image. The format is: 
        image# slice# x-shift y-shift rotation mse
  
   The final output form is written in "zt" dimension order.

     Note: While executing, estireg writes out estimates to 
       Parameter-File to allow for progress checks, and so that
       some results can be obtained even if the program does not
       finish properly.  These are written in "tz" dimension
       order.  This intermediate-stage file is identified by the
       words "Temporary storage:" at the top of the file.

</pre>
<h3>fixed</h3>
<pre>
   [-fixed Fixed-Image-Number]    (-f Fixed-Image-Number)

   Ex: -f 4
   Ex: -f middle

   Specifies that the image to be considered the fixed image (the
   image to which all others are registered) is the image that is
   numbered with the value of Fixed-Image-Number (images numbered
   starting with 0).  
   
   Acceptable values are "middle", "center", or any integer from 0 to
   the extent of the t-dimension minus 1.  "middle" and "center"
   assign Fixed-Image-Number to half of the extent of the
   t-dimension. If the image with the number Fixed-Image-Number is
   considered missing, the first non-missing image following it in the
   sequence (wrapped around to the beginning of the sequence) will be
   considered the fixed image.

   Default value is 0.

</pre>
<h3>align</h3>
<pre>
   [-align Target-Header-File]    (-a Target-Header-File)

   Specifies the header name of the Pittsburgh MRI file from which 
   the target image is to be taken.  Obviously, this file must have
   the same number of slices as Input-Header-File.  The default is
   to use Input-Header-File.  The image number given by
   Fixed-Image-Number is used as the target for alignment.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<pre>

    estireg attempts to estimate the 2-D registration parameters 
    (two rotation parameters [x-shift, y-shift] and a rotation parameter)
    of an image with respect to some fixed image by finding the x-shift,
    y-shift, and rotation that minimize the mean squared error (MSE) 
    between the shifted, rotated image and a version of the fixed image.

    A version of the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm is used to find the
    MSE-minimizing registration parameters.

    The shifted, rotated image is defined by bilinear interpolation from
    the true, shifted, rotated image back onto the fixed Cartesian grid.

    Due to biases in the estimation when this bilinear interpolation is 
    used (which occur primarily with respect to the rotation parameter),
    the version of the fixed image which is used to calculate the MSE
    is actually a rotation of the fixed image, where Fourier interpolation,
    using shearing, is used to calculate the rotated image.  The angle of
    rotation corresponds to the current best MSE-minimizing rotation.
    The bilinearly interpolated registered image is thus rotated by a
    correspondingly smaller angle.

    For more details on this algorithm, see Eddy, Fitzgerald, Noll ---
    "Improved Image Registration Using Fourier Interpolation", 
    Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 36-6 (Dec 1996)

<h3>FFTAlgorithm</h3>
<pre>

  The FFTW package (available from http://www.fftw.org/) is
  used to implement the fast Fourier transforms used in this routine.
  FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) is distributed under
  the Gnu General Public License.

</pre>
<h3>FFTEnvironment</h3>
<pre>

  If the environment variable F_WISDOM_FILE is set, its value will be
  used as the basis for the name of a file in which FFTW will store
  "wisdom".  This is machine-specific information about what precise
  FFT algorithm is fastest on the specific hardware.  This information
  can then be reused, saving a couple of seconds the next time a
  program using FFTW runs.

  Because this information is machine specific, an architecture-
  specific string (usually the same as $PVM_ARCH) is appended to
  the value of F_WISDOM_FILE in forming the filename.

  In parallel runs, FFTW will create one wisdom file per processor,
  by appending processor numbers to the file name.  This is necessary
  to avoid errors due to multiple processes reading and writing the same
  file.
