<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  pghtoafni is a program that converts pgh MRI format files to 
    AFNI format.  

  pghtoafni [-verbose] [-debug] [-anat|-func] [-head|-gen] Infile Outfile

  pghtoafni -help [topic]

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>help</h3>
<pre>

  -help   Engage help system, providing help on topic, if supplied,
            or starting the interactive help system otherwise.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>

  [-verbose]   (-v)

  Ex: -v

  Produces verbose output.

</pre>
<h3>debug</h3>
<pre>

  [-debug]

  Ex: -debug

  Produces debugging output.

</pre>
<h3>Infile</h3>
<pre>

  The name of the Pittsburgh MRI file to be translated.  This argument
  is required.

</pre>
<h3>Outfile</h3>
<pre>

  The name of the AFNI file to be generated.  This argument is
  required.  If Outfile is "whatever", the files "whatever.BRIK"
  and "whatever.HEAD" will be created.

</pre>
<h3>anat</h3>
<pre>

  [-anat]

  AFNI distinguishes between anatomy and functional datasets.  Setting
  this flag will force the output dataset to be of anatomy type;
  otherwise pghtoafni will do its best to guess.

</pre>
<h3>func</h3>
<pre>

  [-func]

  AFNI distinguishes between anatomy and functional datasets.  Setting
  this flag will force the output dataset to be of functional type;
  otherwise pghtoafni will do its best to guess.

</pre>
<h3>head</h3>
<pre>

  [-head]

  AFNI distinguishes between head datasets and generic datasets.
  Setting this flag will force the output dataset to be a head;
  otherwise pghttoafni will do its best to guess.  (In all likelihood 
  it will guess that it is a head).

</pre>
<h3>head</h3>
<pre>

  [-gen]

  AFNI distinguishes between head datasets and generic datasets.
  Setting this flag will force the output dataset to be generic;
  otherwise pghttoafni will do its best to guess.  (In all likelihood 
  it will guess that it is a head).
