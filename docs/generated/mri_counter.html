<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  mri_counter creates a pgh MRI file with one dimension, and stores
  a sequence of integers in that dimension.  The integers simply count
  upward from 0 to the maximum extent given.  This program is useful
  for a variety of tricks in combination with other utilities like
  mri_rpn_math and mri_subsample.

  To run mri_counter use:
    mri_counter [-v] [-chunk Chunk-Name] [-dimension Dimension] 
    -length Length outfile

  or:
    mri_counter -help

</pre>
<h2>Defaults</h2>
<pre>

  Chunk name: images
  Dimension: t


</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>chunk</h3>
<pre>
   [-chunk Chunk-Name]				(-chu|c Chunk-Name)

   Ex: -c missing

   Specifies the chunk name to be constructed, in this case "missing".
  The default value is "images".


</pre>
<h3>dimension</h3>
<pre>
   [-dimension Dimension]			(-dim|d Dimension)

   Ex: -d z

   Specifies the dimension to be constructed, in this case
   "z". mri_counter will only work on one dimension.  The default value is "t".
   
</pre>
<h3>length</h3>
<pre>
   -length Length				(-len|l Length)

   Specifies the extent of the dimension constructed. The numbers
   generated will range from 0 to the value of Length minus 1.  This
   argument is required.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>
   [-verbose]					(-ver|v)

   Shows the progress of mri_counter on your screen.

</pre>
<h3>outfile</h3>
<pre>

   outfile

   The name of the Pittsburgh MRI file to which output is to
   be written.  This argument is required.

</pre>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<pre>

  mri_counter -len 867 kitchen

  This example uses all the defaults. In the outfile "kitchen",
  mri_counter will take the chunk "images" with dimension "t", and give
  is a length of 867.

    mri_counter -v -c up -dim x -len 5 folder

  In this case, the x dimension of the "up" chunk will be copied into a
  new file, "folder", with a length of 5.</pre>
