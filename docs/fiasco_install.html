      <h1>Fiasco Installation Instructions</h1>

Installing Fiasco 4.1 is much easier than installing earlier versions,
though it can still be non-trivial.  

<p>You will need the following third party packages.  
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html">PVM3</a>,
	  available from ftp.netlib.org .  PVM allows Fiasco to run
	  in parallel across multiple CPUs.
<li><a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/index.html">LAPACK</a>, 
a standard library of mathematics routines built on the
Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS).  LAPACK is available from
netlib also, but most vendors provide versions of this library tuned
to their machines.
<li>The <a href="http://www.acm.org/~perlman/statinfo.html">|Stat</a>
	  or <b>Unix Stat</b> package.  See src/mri_unix_stat/README
	  in the Fiasco distribution for
	  the reasons for this requirement.
</ul>
<p>

Splus, available from <a href="http://www.mathsoft.com/">MathSoft</a>,
      is an optional component of Fiasco.  Splus is used only to
	create graphs of statistics.  If you do not have Splus, you
	may wish to try a java-based parameter estimate viewer we
	are developing.  Send mail to
	<a href="mailto:fiasco@stat.cmu.edu">fiasco@stat.cmu.edu</a>
	and ask about ParViewer.

<p>
To install Fiasco 4.1, do the following.
<ol>
<li>Install pvm3, using the instructions included in that package.
	  You should make sure that the install works to the point
	  where you can type the command "pvm" and the PVM daemon and
	  console will start up without error.  Type "halt" at the pvm
	  prompt to stop
	  the daemon and exit the console program. At the end of this
	  process, the following environment variables should be set:
<ul>
<li>PVM_ROOT should point to the place where you installed pvm3.
<li>PVM_ARCH should be the value returned by the script
	      ${PVM_ROOT}/lib/pvmgetarch .
</ul>
<li>Install |Stat according to the instructions included with that
	  package.
<li>Find the vendor's version of LAPACK on your system, or install it.
<li>Get the tar file Fiasco4.1.tar.gz (or .Z) plus any required patches from
	  <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fiasco/download/">
	http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fiasco/download/</a> .
<li>Pick a root directory in which to install Fiasco, for example
	  your home directory.
<li>Use gunzip (or uncompress) to uncompress Fiasco4.1.tar .
<li>Untar Fiasco4.1.tar using the command:
<pre>
<kbd>tar xvf Fiasco4.1.tar</kbd>
</pre>
This will create a subdirectory called Fiasco4.1 .
<li>Use the command <kbd>cd Fiasco4.1</kbd> to move to the new
	  subdirectory.
<li>Install any 
<a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fiasco/fiasco_doc/fiasco_patches.html">
patches</a>.
<li>Customize the file config.mk for your installation.  Instructions
are in the file;  this amounts to telling Fiasco where the other packages
listed above are installed.
<li>If Fiasco doesn't come with a machine-specific Makefile for your
machine and operating system, you will have to create one.  These
files have names line Makefile.HPPA or Makefile.SGI64;  the last
part is the PVM machine type of your machine.  To find that machine
type, issue the command:
<pre>
<kbd>echo $PVM_ARCH</kbd>
</pre>
(If this command didn't work, PVM is not installed correctly or your
are not properly setting the environment variables PVM_ROOT or
PVM_ARCH in your login script).  If you need to do this, it is best
to start with an existing file like Makefile.HPPA and modify it.
<li>Make sure the PVM command <kbd>pvmgetarch</kbd> is in your path.
The command can be found in ${PVM_ROOT}/lib .
<li>Issue the commands:
<pre><kbd>
make depend
make
</kbd></pre>
A lot of compiling should happen, at the end of which Fiasco should
exist on your system.  Machine-specific binaries end up in
Fiasco4.1/bin/${PVM_ARCH} .  The environment variable FIASCO must
	  point to this directory for the package to run properly.
<li>Test the software.  A quick, non-thorough test can be performed as
	  follows.
<ol>
<li>Go to a new, empty directory.
<li>Make sure all the environment variables listed above are set.
<li>Set the environment variable FIASCO to the Fiasco executables
directory, as mentioned above.
<li>Add $FIASCO to the beginning of your path, so the executable
	      FIASCO can be found.
<li>Type "FIASCO epi" .  Fiasco should execute a short EPI analysis,
	      taking a few minutes to do so.  The execution log of the
	      analysis will end up in out/logfile.
</ol>
