<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  pullback takes the values in its input file and the corresponding
  address in the address file and sums the values into the output file
  voxel with the given address.

  Usage:

    pullback [-debug] [-verbose] [-chunk chunkName] -qdim dQ 
       -addr addrFile inFile outFile] 

   where:

     -debug requests debugging output.

     -verbose requests verbose output.

     -qdim dQ is the dimension of the output file.  It must be greater
        than the largest value in addrFile.

     -a addrFile is the address file.  This file must have dimensions
        matching those of inFile, and every value in the file must
        be greater than or equal to zero and less than dQ.

     inFile is the input file.  The product of all the dimensions in
        inFile must match the product of all the dimensions in addrFile.

     outFile is the output file name.  The dimensions of this
        file will be q, with extent qdim.

  or:

    pullback -help [topic]

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  Suppose inFile contains values V(x,y,z) at the voxel with indices x, y,
  and z, and addrFile contains values A(x,y,z), where 0&lt;= A &lt; dQ for
  all x, y, and z.  After execution, outFile will contain values S(q)
  at each of its voxels, where S(q) is the sum of all V(x,y,z) for 
  which A(x,y,z) is equal to q.  The values in inFile have been binned
  into the voxels of outFile according to their associated addresses
  in addrFile.

  The output dataset must fit entirely in memory.</pre>
