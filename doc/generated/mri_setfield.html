<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  mri_setfield.c is used to set the contents of one field from 
  a Pittsburgh MRI dataset, or to delete that field

  To run mri_setfield use:
    mri_setfield -field Field [-all012] [-allxyz] 
         -value Valstring Input-file

  or:
    mri_setfield -field Field [-all012] [-allxyz] -delete Input-file

  or:
    mri_setfield -help [topic]

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>field</h3>
<pre>
  -field Field				(-fld Field)

     Specifies the MRI key field string name to modify or insert.
     This parameter is required.

</pre>
<h3>delete</h3>
<pre>
  -delete				(-del)

     Specifies that the given field should be deleted from the
     Pittsburgh MRI file, leaving nothing in its place.

</pre>
<h3>value</h3>
<pre>
  -value Valstring			(-val Valstring)

     Specifies the new value for the field.  This value is handled as
     a string; if the field is to have a numerical value it is the
     user's responsibility to make sure that the given string is
     parsable as a number. If -all012 or -allxyz are used, the string
     must be a colon-separated list of substrings.

</pre>
<h3>all012</h3>
<pre>
  -all012

     Specifies that three fields should be set or deleted,
     with the names field.0, field.1, and field.2.  If the -delete
     option is not given,  values are taken from successive 
     comma- or colon-separated parts of the value string.  In
     this case the value string must be a colon-separated list,
     for example "17.2:12.4:-3".  This option saves multiple commands
     when manipulating 3D data tags.  Quotes and spaces (and other
     chars for which ispunct() or isspace() returns true) are stripped from
     the beginning and end of the string.

</pre>
<h3>allxyz</h3>
<pre>
  -allxyz

     Specifies that three fields should be set or deleted,
     with the names field.x, field.y, and field.z.  If the -delete
     option is not given,  values are taken from successive 
     comma- or color- colon-separated parts of the value string.  In
     this case the value string must be a colon-separated list,
     for example '17.2,12.4,-3'.  This option saves multiple commands
     when manipulating 3D data tags.  Quotes and spaces (and other
     chars for which ispunct() or isspace() returns true) are stripped from
     the beginning and end of the string.

</pre>
<h3>infile</h3>
<pre>
  infile

  Ex: Input_file

  The value of infile specifies the input dataset. This argument is required.

</pre>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<pre>

  Do not use this tool to delete chunks, or to change the names of
  chunks.  mri_delete_chunk and mri_copy_chunk should be used for 
  these tasks.
