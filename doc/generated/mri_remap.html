<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>


  mri_remap is used to change the dimensions on a chunk of data within
  an MRI dataset in Pittsburgh format.  The actual data is not changed.
  This is useful to add dimensions (with extent 1) to the chunk or to
  relabel the chunk's dimensions.  For instance, we may subdivide one
  dimension into two others: assume we have 36 images in the t dimension
  -- then we can redimension the chunk to have a c ("condition")
  dimension of 4 and a t dimension of 9.

  To run mri_remap use:
    mri_remap [-chunk Chunk-name] [-order New-dimensions] 
       [-length New-extents] [-verbose] [-preserve] infile
  or:
    mri_remap -help [topic]

</pre>
<h2>Defaults</h2>
<pre>

  Unless you define the following optional elements, mri_remap will use
  these defaults:

  Chunk name: "images"
  Dimension order: vxyzt
  Extent: (if not present in original chunk) 1

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>chunk</h3>
<pre>
  [-chunk Chunk-name]		(-chu|c Chunk-name)

  Ex: -chunk counts

  Specifies that "counts" is the chunk that is to be operated on.
  Default value is "images".


</pre>
<h3>order</h3>
<pre>
  [-order New-dimensions]      (-ord|o New-dimensions)

  Specifies that the chunk should be rearranged to have the given
  Dimension order "tzyxv".  Default value is "vxyzt".

</pre>
<h3>length</h3>
<pre>
  [-length New-lengths]		(-len|l New-extents)

  Specifies the extents of the new dimensions.  These are given as a
  list of integers, separated by commas, colons, or spaces.  If a
  dimension is left out, like the second dimension in "2::3", then the
  extent will be the same as the dimension in the existing chunk.  If
  the dimension was not present in the existing chunk, the extent will
  default to 1. 

  Default is "", i.e. all extents will be copied from the dimension's
  extent in the existing chunk, and if not found there, will be
  assumed to be 1.

  The total chunk size specified by the new set of dimensions and
  extents must match the current size of the chunk.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>
  [-verbose]				(-ver|v)

  Turning on the verbose option gives you more information about what
  mri_remap is doing.

</pre>
<h3>preserve</h3>
<pre>
  [-preserve]

  Turning on this option prevents mri_remap from deleting key-value 
  pairs associated with the deleted dimensions.  In general these pairs
  are irrelevant or invalid once their dimensions are gone, but
  sometimes (for example if the dimensions will shortly be put back!)
  one wants to keep them around.

</pre>
<h3>infile</h3>
<pre>
  infile

  Ex: detrend

  The value of infile specifies the input dataset. This argument is required.

</pre>
<h2>Calculation</h2>
<pre>

  mri_remap just changes the header of the dataset to reflect the new
  dimensions and extents.  It does not modify the actual data so it
  should be an inexpensive operation no matter how large the chunk is
  on disk.

</pre>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>

  To reorganize the chunk named "chocolate", within a file named
  "fudge", with the original dimension order "xyz", and original extents
  "1:2:3", you would use the following command:

  mri_remap -chunk chocolate -o zyx -l 2:3:1 -v fudge

  In this case, the chunk "chocolate" (within "fudge") would now have
  a dimention order of "zyx" and extents "2:3:1". How delicious.
