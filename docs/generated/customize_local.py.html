<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  This script customizes the various Fiasco *.local.csh files for
  a specific case.  Its implementation depends on the research
  project for which it is to be used, and thus it is not portable
  between projects.

  customize_local.py [-v] [-d] [--src=srcDir] key1=val1 
    key2=val2 ... fileToCustomize

   -v requests verbose output
   -d requests debugging output
   --src=srcDir means read the original file from srcDir

  if the --src option is not used, the source file will come from
  the directory specified by the FIASCO environment variable.
