INSTALLATION

To install gift, you must first have installed the libmri library to
allow reading and writing the PGH format.  If you install gift in a
sister directory of libmri, then the Makefile will work without
alterations.  If libmri is located elsewhere, then change the OPTIONS
and LIBS definitions to refer to the proper directories.

To compile, cd to the gift directory and do a "make".  The resulting
executable "gift" can then be moved to an appropriate bin directory.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE

For basic usage information, simply type "gift" without any arguments.
This will output something similar to the following:

Usage: gift -to <format> <filename_1> ... <filename_n>
           [-delete]
           [-compress]
           [-o|outname <output_name>]
           [-bei] [-beo] [-lei] [-leo]
           [-slice <slice_number_range>]
           [-time <time_number_range>]
       where <format> is one of:
           FIASCO  PGH  ANALYZE  SPIRAL_SL  
       and:
         -delete deletes the input file after conversion
         -compress compresses the output
         -o specifies the output name
         -bei -beo -lei -leo specifies big-endian-input, ...
         -slice -time designate subsets of the input file

Input filenames must follow all other options on the command line.
Other than that, the options and input files filenames may occur in 
any order on the command line.

The filenames supplied on the command line are interpreted
as if they had an implicit '*' after them.  Thus, to specify
a collection of "sl" files as the input, it is only necessary
to type "sl" and this will be expanded to encompass all files
beginning with "sl".

It is possible to use a directory prefix in the -o filename.
For output formats that typically consist of many files (e.g.
ANALYZE and SPIRAL_SL), the directory will be created
if necessary.

EXAMPLES

To convert a collection of ANALYZE files in the temp2 subdirectory
to temp3 in the PGH format:
	gift -to pgh -o temp3 temp2/
This will create temp3.mri and temp3.dat in the current directory.

To convert a PGH file named "test.mri" to ANALYZE format, leaving
the analyze files in a subdirectory named test2, and prefixed
with the letters exp1
	gift -to analyze -o test2/exp1 test

To convert only times 3 through 5, inclusive, from a set of
SPIRAL_SL files and put the result in a FIASCO file:
	gift -to fiasco -time 3-5 -o fiasco1 sl

NOTES ON SPECIFIC FORMATS

FIASCO:
	Dimensions in the data must be in vxyzt order, though
	the v (vector), z, and t dimensions may be omitted in
	any combination.

PGH:
	Compression is not supported.  Eventually compression
	will be supported within the libmri library itself.
	If the output format is PGH, a single file containing
	both header and image data may be written, or the
	image data may be place in a separate file with
	extension ".dat".
	The user can control this with the flags:
	    -split	(generates one .mri file and one .dat file)
	    -single     (generates one .mri file)
	The default is -split.

ANALYZE:
	If the output format is ANALYZE, a single file may
	be written, or multiple files (one per timestep).
	The user can control this with the flags:
	    -split      (generates one file per timestep)
	    -single	(generates one file)
	The default is -split.

SPIRAL_SL:
	For spiral_sl datasets with multiple coils, it is
	possible to select the coil with the flag:
	    -coil <integer>
