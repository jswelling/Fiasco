<h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre>

  mri_sort sorts a Pgh MRI dataset of any type.

  To run mri_sort use: 

    mri_sort [-keyfield Keyfield] [-c Chunk] [-ascending] 
      [-verbose] infile outfile

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<h3>keyfield</h3>
<pre>
  [-keyfield Keyfield]			(-key Keyfield)

  The given chunk must have a first dimension v; it is sorted on its
  second dimension.  If the length of v is greater than 1, keyfield
  specifies which v to use to sort the second dimension.  Counting
  starts from 0.  Default value is 0.


</pre>
<h3>chunk</h3>
<pre>
  [-chunk Chunk]			(-chu|c Chunk)

  Specifies which chunk to sort.  Default is "images". 

  The given chunk must have a first dimension v; it is sorted on its
  second dimension.

  It is an error to try to sort the "missing" chunk.  Note that you
  can use mri_rpn_math to replace all missing data with values that
  will sort to one end of the output.

</pre>
<h3>ascending</h3>
<pre>
  [-ascending]				(-asc)

  Causes sort to happen in ascending order.  Default is descending.

</pre>
<h3>verbose</h3>
<pre>
  [-verbose]				(-ver|v)

  Requests verbose operation.

</pre>
<h3>infile</h3>
<pre>
  infile

  Ex: ToBeSorted

  The value of infile specifies the input dataset. This argument is required.

</pre>
<h3>outfile</h3>
<pre>
  outfile

  Ex: SortedFile

  The value of outfile specifies the output dataset.  This argument is
  required.
