<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  Given a dataset in time series order and a mask selecting some
  subset of the voxels in the dataset, plot_roi_time_series.py
  generates a Postscript plot of the time series of the selected
  voxels and the temporal running mean of their spatial mean.

   plot_roi_time_series.py [-v][-d] [--title TitleString]
      [--bars BarLocString] [--autobars] [--window WindowLength]
      -r RoiMaskDS --out Output.ps InFile

  where
    -v specifies verbose output
    -d specifies debugging output
    --title TitleString provides an overall title for the graph.
    --bars BarLocString accepts a comma-separated list of bar
      locations as a parameter string.  Vertical bars are drawn
      at these locations to help with identifying specific blocks
      or trials.  Bar locations are in units of the scan TR.
    --autobars is equivalent to --bars, but with a set of bar
      locations hard-coded into the script.  The user may find it
      easier to edit the script than to provide a long list of bars
      on the command line.  Bar locations are in units of the scan TR.
    --window WindowLength allows the user to specify an integer 
      width in time for the running mean window. (default 6)
    -r RoiMaskDS specifies the name of the ROI mask, a dataset in
      (v)xyz(t) order.
    --out Output.ps specifies the name of the output file (default plot.ps)
    InFile is the input dataset, which must be in (v)txyz order.

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>

  Suppose one has a standard Fiasco single-subject directory, with 
  time series dataset data/permute.mri and an ROI mask dataset called
  mask.mri .  (The latter dataset might have been constructed using
  pullback_roi_mask.py from Talairached data, for example).  To
  generate a plot, one might do:

    plot_roi_time_series.py -v --title "This is a sample plot"
      --bars "10.1,15.2,21.3" --window 8 -r mask --out myplot.ps data/permute

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  Based on the mask the time series for the selected voxels are read
  into the script.  A temporal running mean (with the given width) of
  the spatial mean of those samples is constructed.  An R sub-process
  is spawned and used to generate the Postscript plot of the given
  time series.  The X axis measures the temporal sample number, so it
  typically is in units of TRs.  The Y axis measures MR signal
  intensity, so it typically is in 'standard MR units'.
