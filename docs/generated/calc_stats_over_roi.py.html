<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  calc_stats_over_roi.py calculates a 5-number summary (min, 1q,
  median, 3q, and max) of an input dataset within the bounds of
  a mask.  It is designed to work specifically within the context
  of the Fiasco implementation of normalized data.

  calc_stats_over_roi.py [-v] [-d] [-l lowThresh] [-h highThresh]
         [--basepath BasePath] -r RoiMaskDSet StatDS

   where:
    -v specifies verbose output
    -d specifies debugging output
    -l lowThresh specifies a minimum value in the normalized axial
       dataset below which points are to be excluded (default 0.0)
    -h highThresh specifies a maximum value in the normalized axial
       dataset above which points are to be excluded (default 1e6)
    --basePath BasePath specifies the path to the directory holding
       the standard Fiasco subdirectories 'stat', 'anat', 
       'generated_scripts', etc. (default ./)
    -r RoiMaskDSet specifies the mask dataset (values 0=outside,
       1=inside) for the region of interest.
    StatDS specifies the statistic to sample.  This file must exist 
       in the 'stat' subdirectory of BasePath; for example "GrandMean".

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  To be included in the summary, a voxel in the StatDS dataset must
  meet the following criteria:

    - The value of RoiMaskDSet must be non-zero at that voxel.
    - The value of normalized_anat/norm_warped_stripped_axial must
      be greater than or equal to lowThresh at that voxel.
    - The value of normalized_anat/norm_warped_stripped_axial must
      be less than or equal to highThresh at that voxel.
    - The value of StatDS must be finite (non NaN, Inf, NInf, or any
      other funky non-finite IEEE floating point value) at that voxel.

  If all of those criteria are met, the value at that voxel goes on
  a list of valid voxels.  The output line of the script contains
  the following values calculated from that list, in order:

  min  1quartile  median  3quartile  max  count

  where count is the number of valid samples.

  Obviously, lowThresh and highThresh can be used to restrict sampling
  to gray matter voxels, if the threshold values for gray matter in
  the particular structural scan are known.

  Note that the script will produce normalized versions of the
  stripped axial dataset and the statistics dataset in question using
  the appropriate generated scripts if those normalized datasets do
  not exist.
