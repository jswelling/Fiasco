    <h1>make_phase_cine.csh</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  make-phase-cine.csh produces an MPEG animation from a Pgh MRI file
  containing a time series of complex images.  The input file must have
  dimensions vxy(z)(t), where the extent of v is 2.

    make_phase_cine.csh [-b] [-d] [-r] myfile.mri

  or

    make_phase_cine.csh -help [topic]

  The output file will have the name myfile.mpg .

</pre>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<pre>

  -b brightens the output images
  -d dims the output images
  -r reverses black and white

  myfile.mri is the file to be converted to MPEG.  It will be mosaiced
  so that all the Z slices appear on one frame.

</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  make_phase_cine.csh uses the commands "convert" and "identify" to generate
  the MPEG file.  If these tools are not installed on your system, 
  make_phase_cine.csh will complain and exit.  

  make_phase_cine.csh uses color_by_phase.csh to generate the images
  for individual frames; see the documentation for that script for
  details about the mapping of complex numbers to colors.  A one pixel
  border with complex phase pi/4 and maximum magnitude is added around
  the individual slices.
  The actual output image has intensity given by:

   I= sqrt( (V - Vmin)/(Vmax - Vmin) )

  where V is the input value for a pixel, and Vmax and Vmin are the
  maximum and minimum values for all pixels over all times.  The
  square root is done to produce a better visual distribution of
  brightness.  A one pixel border is added.

  Intermediate files are produced in a directory with a name like
  make_phase_cine_tmp_??? where ??? is some integer (specifically the 
  process ID).  This directory will be in $F_TEMP, or in the local
  directory if the environment variable F_TEMP is not defined.  If
  make_phase_cine.csh should fail for any reason you will want to delete 
  that directory, since the intermediate files can be fairly big.
  If make_phase_cine.csh finishes normally, it will clean up the directory.

  make_phase_cine.csh may also fail if the output image size is too large.
  This can happen if there are a great many slices, or if the slices
  are very large.  If this happens use mri_subset to create a dataset
  with fewer slices.  It can also fail if your machine runs out of
  swap space while the mpeg movie is being assembled.
