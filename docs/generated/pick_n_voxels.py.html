<h2>Overview</h2>
<pre>

  pick_n_voxels.py takes as input a desired count of active voxels and
  a Pmap or Tmap , and produces the cutoff P or T score for the requested count.

  pick_n_voxels.py [-v] [-d] [--twotails] [--mask maskDS] -T|-P|-F count mapDS

   -v requests verbose output
   -d requests debugging output
   --twotails includes both tails of the distribution in the count.
     This is incompatible with -F 
   -T specifies that mapDS is a Tmap
   -P specifies that mapDS is a Pmap
   -F specifies that mapDS is an Fmap
   --mask maskDS specifies that maskDS contains a mask for mapDS.
      Only voxels within that map are counted.  All voxel values
      should be either 0 or 1.
   count is the desired number of active voxels (an integer)
   mapDS is the name of the Pgh MRI dataset containing the Tmap or Pmap

<h2>Details</h2>
<pre>

  Without the --twotails or --mask options, this script simply sorts
  the given voxel values and picks the lowest N.  For Pmaps or Tmaps
  sorting is done in ascending order; for Fmaps the order is descending.

  With --twotails, the values are first "folded" so that the high and
  low tails of the distribution overlay each other.  For Tmaps this
  implies multiplying all positive values by -1.  Thus if
  pick_n_voxels.py returns a value V for a T threshold, V will be
  negative and the high and low thresholds will be +V and -V.
  For obvious reasons the --twotails option cannot be used with Fmaps.

  When --twotails is applied to Pmaps, all P values above 0.5 are
  replaced by (1-P).  Thus if pick_n_voxels.py returns a value V for a
  P threshold, the two tails lie below P and above 1-P.

  The mask dataset is a dataset of 0 and 1 values, typically made by
  thresholding the GrandMean dataset to exclude voxels outside the
  brain. Masking is implemented by replacing P scores outside the mask
  with 1.0, and T and F scores outside the mask with 0.0.  This replacement
  takes place after the folding-over of the right-hand tail if
  --twotails is set.  Note that this algorithm can cause problems if 
  the requested number of selected voxels is more than half of the 
  number within the mask!  Fortunately this condition is obvious; all 
  voxels outside the mask will suddenly be selected.  

  There are special floating point values in the IEEE standard for
  floating point numbers which represent "not a number" or "infinite"
  values;  pick_n_voxels.py ignores those entries when it calculates
  the P score cutoff.  This means that you can mask out parts of the
  input data that you would like to ignore by setting them equal to
  "NaN" using (for example) mri_rpn_math.  This is over and above any
  masking implemented with the --mask flag.

  If you request N voxels and then count the number of voxels actually
  selected, you may find a number which is 1 or 2 off from N.  This
  happens because of the difficulty of converting a high-precision
  floating point number to base-10 ascii characters and back.  This
  problem is more serious with Pmaps than with Tmaps, since a lot of 
  the interesting P scores fall very close to the values 0.0 or 1.0.

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>

  A shell script would typically use pick_n_voxels.csh to generate
  a T score cutoff, and then mask the Tmap using that threshold.  
  For example, using the Fiasco "overlay" utility to highlight
  the negative tail of the T distribution:

    set val = `pick_n_voxels.py -T 2000 Tmap`

    overlay.csh -inmap Tmap -inimage mean_image -headerout masked_t 
      -highthresh 10000 -lowthresh $val

  The high threshold is an unlikely T score of 10000; the low
  threshold is inferred from the desired voxel count.  

  Setting the high T value for a two-tailed overlay is tricky inside
  a Cshell script because it involves floating point arithmetic
  (multiplying a floating point number by -1).  Be sure to properly
  implement this if you want two-tailed overlays!

  To generate an overlay from only those voxels within the brain, one
  might make a mask by thresholding the mean values for all image
  voxels:

    mri_rpn_math -out mymask '$1,800,&lt;' GrandMean
    set val = `pick_n_voxels.py --mask mymask -T 2000 Tmap`
    overlay.csh -inmap Tmap -inimage GrandMean -headerout masked_t 
      -highthresh 10000 -lowthresh $val

  Values can also be masked out by setting them to the IEEE value
  "NaN" (meaning Not a Number).  For example,

    mri_rpn_math -o Pmap_masked '$1,NaN,$2,800,&gt;,if_keep' Pmap GrandMean
    set val = `pick_n_voxels.py -P 2000 Pmap_masked`
    overlay.csh -inmap Pmap -inimage GrandMean -headerout masked_p 
      -highthresh 2.0 -lowthresh $val

<h2>Environment</h2>
<pre>

  pick_n_voxels.py keeps scratch files in a temporary directory.
  If the environment variable F_TEMP is defined this directory will 
  be ${F_TEMP}/tmp_pickn_NN (where NN is the current process ID);
  otherwise ./tmp_pickn_NN will be used.  The temporary directory is
  deleted when pick_n_voxels.py is finished with it.
